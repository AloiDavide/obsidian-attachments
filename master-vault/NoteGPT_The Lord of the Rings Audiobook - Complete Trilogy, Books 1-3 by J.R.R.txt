          [Music] recorded Books Incorporated presents an unabridged recording of the Fellowship of the Ring the first volume in The Lord of the Rings trilogy by JRR toin narrated by Robert this performance is copyrighted 1990 by recorded books incorporated three rings for the Elven Kings under the sky seven for the dwarf Lords in their holes of stone nine for Mortal men doomed to die one for the dark lord on his dark throne in the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie one ring to rule them all one ring to

          find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness find them in the land of Mordor where the Shadows [Music] lie this tale grew in the telling until it became a history of the Great War of the Ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history that preceded it it was begun soon after The Hobbit was written and before its publication in 1937 but I did not go on with this sequel for I wished first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder days which had then

          
          01:50
          been taking shape for some years I desired to do this for my own satisfaction and I had little hope that other people would be interested in this work especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of history for Elvish tongues when those Whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope to no hope I went back to the sequel encouraged by requests from readers for more information concerning Hobbits and their Adventures but the story was drawn

          
          02:26
          irresistibly towards the older world and became an account as it were of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been told the process had begun in the writing of The Hobbit in which there were already some references to the older matter elrond gondolin the High Elves and the Orcs as well as glimpses that had Arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface durin Moria Gandalf the The Necromancer the ring the discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation

          to the ancient histories revealed the third age and its culmination in the war of the ring those who had asked for more information about Hobbits eventually got it but they had to wait a long time for the composition of the Lord of the Rings went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949 a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect and many other interests as a learner and a teacher that often absorbed me the delay was of course also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939 by the end of which year the tale

          
          03:45
          had not yet reached the end of book one in spite of the darkness of the next 5 years I found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned and I ploted on mostly by night till I stood by barin's tomb in Moria there I halted for a long while it was almost a year later when I went on and so came to lloran and the Great River late in 1941 in the next year I wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as book three and the beginnings of chapters 1 and three of book five and there as the beacons fled in anoran and

          Theoden came to harale I stopped foresight had failed and there was no time time for thought it was during 1944 that leaving the Loose Ends and perplexities of a war which it was my task to conduct or at least to report I forced myself to tackle the Journey of Frodo to Mordor these chapters eventually to become book four were written and sent out as a serial to my son Christopher then in South Africa with the RAF nonetheless it took another 5 years before the tale was brought to its present end in that time I changed my

          
          05:03
          house my chair and my college and the days though less dark were no less laborious then when the end had at last been reached the whole story had to be revised and indeed largely Rewritten backwards and it had to be typed and retyped by me the cost of professional typing by the 10 fingered was beyond my means the Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print and I should like to say something here with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning the

          
          05:42
          motives and meaning of the tale the prime motive was the desire of a tail tell to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers amuse them Delight them and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them as a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault some who have read the book or at any rate have reviewed it have found it boring absurd or contemptible and I have no cause to complain since I have similar opinions

          
          06:18
          of their works or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer but even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please it is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points nor to displease everybody at the same points for I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved the most critical reader of all myself now finds many defects minor and

          
          06:53
          major but being fortunately under no obligation either to review the book or to write it again he will pass over these in silence except one that has been noted by others the book is too short as for any inner meaning or message it has in the intention of the author none it is neither allegorical nor topical as the story grew it put down Roots into the past and threw out unexpected branches but its main theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the ring as the link between it and the hobby it the

          
          07:31
          crucial chapter the shadow of the past is one of the oldest parts of the tale It Was Written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster and from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same lines if that disaster had been averted its sources are things long before in mind or in some cases already written and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels the real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its

          conclusion if it had inspired or directed the development of the legend then certainly the ring would have been seized and used against sain he would not have been annihilated but enslaved and badur would not have been destroyed but occupied Saron failing to get possession of the Ring would in the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into ring law and before long he would have made a great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-

          styled ruler of Middle Earth in that conflict both sides would have held Hobbits in hatred and contempt they would not long have survived even as slaves other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like Al or topical reference but I cordially dislike aligre in all its manifestations and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence I much prefer history true or feigned with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of

          
          09:18
          readers I think that many confuse applicability with allegory but the one resides in the freedom of the reader and the other in the purposed domination of the author an author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience but the ways in which a story germ uses the soil of experience are extremely complex and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous it is also false though naturally attractive when the lives of an author and critic have overlapped to

          
          09:54
          suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times common to both were necessarily the most powerful influences one has indeed personally to come under the shadow of War to feel fully its oppression but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in Youth by 1914 was no less hideous in experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years by 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead or to take a less Grievous matter it has been supposed by some that

          may discover much of their character and a little of their history further in information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of West March that has already been published under the title of The Hobbit that story was derived from the earlier chapters of the red book composed by Bilbo himself the first Hobbit to become famous in the World At Large and called by him there and back again since they told of his journey into the East and his return an adventure which later involved all the

          hobbits and the great events of that age that are here related many however may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset while some may not possess the earlier book for such readers a few notes on the more important points are here collected from Hobbit law and the first Adventure is briefly recalled Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people more numerous for norly than they are today for they love peace and quiet and Good tilled Earth a well-ordered and well-armed Countryside

          was their favorite haunt they do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a forge Bellows a water mill or a handloom though they were skillful with tools even in ancient days they were as a rule shy of the big folk as they call us and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find they are quick of hearing and sharp eyed and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily they are nonetheless Nimble and deaft in their movements they possess from the first

          the art of Disappearing swiftly and silently when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by and this art they have developed until to men it may seem magical but Hobbits have never in fact studied magic of any kind and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice and a close friendship with the Earth have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races for they are a little people smaller than dwarves less Stout and stocky that is even when they are not

          medy folk they dressed in bright colors being notably fond of yellow and green but they seldom wore shoes since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a thick curling hair much like the hair of their heads which was commonly Brown thus the only craft little practiced among them was shoe making for they had long and skillful fingers and could make many other useful and comely things their faces were as a rule good natured rather than beautiful broad brigh eyed red cheeked with mouths apt

          to laughter and to eating and drinking and laugh they did and eat and drink often and heartily being fond of simple gests at all times and of six meals a day when they could get them they were hospitable and delighted in parties and in presence which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted it is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits of relatives of ours far nearer to us than elves or even than dwarves of old they spoke the languages of men after their own fashion and liked and disliked much

          
          16:23
          the same things as men did but what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered the beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the Elder days that are now lost and forgotten only the elves still preserve any records of that vanished time and their Traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history in which men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all yet it is clear that Hobbits had in fact lived quietly in Middle Earth for many long years before other folk became even aware of them

          
          17:00
          and the world being after all full of strange creatures Beyond count these little people seemed of very little importance but in the days of Bilbo and of Frodo Hiser they suddenly became by no wish of their own both important and renowned and troubled the counsels of the wise and the great those days the third age of Middle Earth are now long past and the shape of all lands is has been changed but the regions in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger the northwest of the

          
          17:38
          Old World East of the Sea of their original home The Hobbit in Bilbo's time preserved no knowledge a love of learning other than genealogical law was far from General among them but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from elves dwarves and Men their own records began only after the settlement of the Sha and their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their wandering days it is clear nonetheless from these

          
          18:15
          Legends and from the evidence of their peculiar words and Customs that like many other folk Hobbits had in the distant past moved Westward their earliest Tales seemed to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper veils of andwin between the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains why they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains into arador is no longer certain their own accounts speak of the multiplying of men in the land and of a shadow that fell on the forest so that

          it became darkened and its new name was merkwood before the crossing of the mountains the hobbits had already become divided in to three somewhat different breeds half foots stews and fello hides the halot were Browner of skin smaller and shorter and they were beardless and bootless their hands and feet were neat and Nimble and they preferred Highlands and hillsides the stores were broader heavier in build their feet and hands were larger and they preferred flat lands and riversides the fellow Ides were fairer

          of skin and also of hair and they were taller and Slimmer than the others they were lovers of trees and of Woodlands the half foots had much to do with dwarves in ancient times and long lived in the foothills of the mountains they moved Westward early and roamed over arador as far as weathertop while the others were still in wilderland they were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit and far the most numerous they were the most inclined to settle in one place and longest preserved their ancestral habit of

          
          20:06
          living in tunnels and homes the stores lingered long by the banks of the Great River andwin and were less shy of men they came West after the halfs and followed the course of the loudwater Southwoods and there many of them long dwelt between thed and the borders of dunland before they moved North again the pho hides the least numerous were a Northerly Branch they were more friendly with elves than the other Hobbits were and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts and of old they

          
          20:43
          preferred hunting to tilling they crossed the mountains north of rivendel and came down the river horwell in arador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had preceded them but being somewhat Bolder and More Adventurous they they were often found as Leaders or Chieftains among clans of Halfords or stores even in Bilbo's time the strong fellow hi highish strain could still be noted among the greater families such as the tkes and the Masters of Buckland in the Westlands of arador between the Misty Mountains and the

          still endured though reduced in size this was at Brie and the Chetwood that lay round about some 40 m east of the sh it was in these early days doubtless that the hobbits learned their letters and began to write after the matter of the dunad who had in their turn long before learned the art from The Elves and in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before and spoke Ever After the common speech the westron as it was named that was current through through all the lands of the Kings from aror to Gondor and about

          
          22:33
          all the coasts of the sea from belfalas to Lon yet they kept a few words of their own as well as their own names of months and days and a great store of personal names out of the past about this time Legend among the hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning of years for it was in the 1,61 year of the Third age that the fallohide brothers Marco and Blanco set out from brie and having obtained permission from The High King at fornost they crossed the brown River bandin with a great following of Hobbits they passed

          
          23:14
          over the bridge of stone bows that had been built in the days of the power of the north Kingdom and they took all the land Beyond to dwell in between the river and the far Downs all that was demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair and all other Bridges and Roads Speed The King's Messengers and acknowledge his lordship thus began the sh Reckoning for the year of the crossing of the Brandy Wine as the hobbits turned the name became year one of the Sha and all later dates were

          
          23:47
          reckoned from it at once the Western Hobbits fell in love with their new land and they remained there and soon passed once more out of the history of men and of elves while there was still a king they were in name his subjects but they were in fact ruled by their own Chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside to the last battle of fornost with the witch Lord of Angar they sent some Bowman to the aid of the king or so they maintained though no Tales of men record it but in that war the north

          Kingdom ended and then the hobbits took the land for their own and they chose from their own Chiefs aane to hold the authority of the king that was gone there for a thousand years they were little troubled by Wars and they prospered and multiplied After the Dark plague sh Reckoning 37 until the disaster of The Long Winter and the famine that followed it many thousands then perished but the days of Dar 1158 to 1160 were at the time of this tale long ped and the hobbits had again become accustomed to plenty the

          
          25:01
          land was rich and kindly and though it had long been deserted when they entered it it had before been well tilled and there the king had once had many farms cornlands Vineyards and woods 40 leagues it stretched from the far Downs to the Brandywine bridge and 50 from the northern Moors to the marshes in the South the hobbits named it the Sha as the region of the authority of their th and a district of well-ordered business and there in that Pleasant corner of the world they plied their well-ordered

          
          25:39
          business of living and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle Earth and the right of all sensible folk they forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians and of the labors of those that made possible the long piece of the Sha they were in fact sheltered but they had ceased to remember it at no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike and they had never fought among themselves in olden days they had

          
          26:16
          of course been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world but in Bilbo's time that was very ancient history the last battle before this story open and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the Sha was beyond living memory the Battle of greenfields sh Reckoning 1147 in which bandas took routed an invasion of Orcs even the weathers had grown milder and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in bitter white Winters were now only a grandfather's tale so though there were

          
          26:57
          still some stort of weapons in the sh these were used mostly As trophies hanging above hards or on walls or gathered into the museum at Mel deling the matham house it was called for anything that Hobbits had no immediate use for but were unwilling to throw away they called a matham their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with matthams and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that sort nonetheless ease and peace had left these people still curiously tough they were if it came to it difficult to daunt

          
          27:36
          or to kill and they were perhaps so unwearying fond of good things not least because they could when put to it do without them and could survive rough handling by grief foe or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces the though slow to quarrel and for sport killing nothing that lived they were Dy at Bay and at need could still handle arms they shot well with a bow for they were Keen eyed and short at the Mark not only with bows and arrows if

          
          28:15
          any Hobbit stooped for a stone it was well to get quickly undercover as all trespassing beasts knew very well all Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground or so they believed and in such dwellings they still felt most at home but in the course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of Abode actually in the Shire in Bilbo's days it was as a rule only the richest and the poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom the poorest went on living in Burrows of the most primitive

          
          28:53
          kind mere holes indeed with only one window or none while the to do still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of old but suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels or Smiles as they called them were not everywhere to be found and in the flats and The low-lying Districts The Hobbits as they multiplied began to build above ground indeed even in the hilly regions and the older Villages such as hobbiton or tubar or in the chief town ship of the Sha Mel delving on the white Downs there were now many

          
          29:33
          houses of wood brick or stone these were specially favored by Millers Smiths Ropers and cart rites and others of that sort for even when they had holes to live in Hobbits had long been accustomed to build sheds and Workshops the habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants of the madish Down by the brand wine the hobbits of that quarter the East Farthing were rather large and heavy legged and they wore dwarf boots in muddy weather but they were well known to be stores in a large part of

          
          30:11
          their blood as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their chins no half or fallohide had any trace of a beard indeed the folk of the Mish and of Buckland east of the river which they afterwards occupied came for the most part later in to the Sha up from Southway and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not found elsewhere in the Sha it is probable that the craft of building as many other crafts beside was derived from the dunad but the hobbits may have learned it direct from the elves the teachers of

          
          30:49
          men in their youth for the elves of the high Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle Earth and they dwelt still at that time at the gry away to the west and in other places within reach of the Shar three elf towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the tower Hills beyond the Western marches they sha far off in the Moonlight the tallest was furthest away standing alone upon a green Mound the hobbits of the West Farthing said that one could see the sea from the top of that Tower but no Hobbit had ever been

          
          31:26
          known to climb it indeed few Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the sea and fewer still had ever returned to report it most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats with deep misgivings and not many of them could swim and as the days of the sh lengthened they spoke less and less with the elves and grew afraid of them and distrustful of those that had dealings with them and the Sea became a word of fear among them and a token of death and they turned their faces away from the hills in the west the craft of building may have come

          
          32:05
          from elves or men but the hobbits used it in their own fashion they did not go in for Towers their houses were usually long low and comfortable the oldest kind were indeed no more than built imitations of smiles thatched with dry grass or straw or rued with turbs and having walls somewhat bulged that stage however belonged to the early days of the sh and Hobbit building had long since been altered improved by devices learned from dwarves or discovered by themselves a preference for round windows and even round doors was the

          
          32:48
          chief remaining peculiarity of Hobbit architecture the houses and the holes of sh Hobbits were often large and inhabited by large families Bilbo and Frodo baggin were as Bachelors very exceptional as they were also in many other ways such as their friendship with elves sometimes as in the case of the tokes of Great Smiles or the Brandy Buck of Brandy Hall many generations of relatives lived in comparative peace together in one ancestral and many tunneled Mansion all Hobbits were in any case clannish and reckoned up their

          
          33:30
          relationships with great care they drew long and elaborate family trees with innumerable branches in dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related to whom and in what degree it would be impossible in this book to set out a family tree that included even the more important members of the more important families at the time which these Tales tell of the genealogical trees at the end of the red book of West March are a small book in themselves and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull

          
          34:05
          Hobbits delighted in such things if they were accurate they liked to have books filled with things that they already knew set out fair and square with no contradictions two concerning pipeweed there is another thing about the hobbits of old that must be mentioned an astonishing habit they imbibed or inhaled through pipes of clay or wood the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb which they called pipe weed or Leaf a variety probably of nicana a great deal of mystery surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom or

          
          34:50
          art as the hobbits preferred to call it all that could be discovered about it in Antiquity was put together by Mar OK br Buck later master of Buckland and since he and the tobacco of the South Farthing play a part in the history that follows his remarks in the introduction to his herblore of the Sha may be quoted this he says is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own invention when Hobbits first began to smoke is not known all the Legends and family histories take it for granted for

          
          35:25
          ages folk in the Shire smoked various herbs some Fowler some sweeter but all accounts agree that tub old Hornblower of long bottom in the South Farthing first grew the true pipe weed in his Gardens in the days of Eisen Grim II about the year 1070 of Sher Reckoning the best homegrown still comes from that District especially the varieties now known as long bottom Leaf old Toby and Southern Star how old Toby came by the plant is not recorded for to his dying day he would not tell he knew much about herbs

          
          36:05

          38:49
          time of this history these names were no longer found only in their proper folklands nearly all tkes still lived in the TK land but that was not true of many other families such as the bines or the boffins outside the farings were the East and West marches the Buckland and the West March added to the sh in sh Reckoning 1462 the sh at this time had hardly any government families for the most part managed their own Affairs growing food and eating it occupied most of their time in other matters they were as a

          rule generous and not greedy but contented and moderate so that Estates Farms workshops and small trades tended to remain unchanged for Generations there remained of course the ancient tradition concerning the high King at fornost or norbury as they called it away north of the Sha but there had been no King for nearly a thousand years and even the ruins of Kings norb were covered with the grass yet The Hobbit still said of wild folk and wicked things such as trolls that they had not heard of the king for they

          longer occurred the th ship had ceased to be more than a nominal dignity the Tuk family was still indeed accorded a special respect for it remained both numerous and exceedingly wealthy and was liable to produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar habits and even adventurous temperament the latter qualities however were now rather tolerated in the rich than generally approved the custom endured nonetheless of referring to the head of the family as the toque and of adding to his name if required a number such as

          
          41:24
          Eisen Grim II for instance the only real official in the Shar at this date was the mayor of ml delving or of the sha who was elected every seven years at the Free Fair on the white Downs at the lie that is at Midsummer as mayor almost his only duty was to preside at Banquets given on the sh holidays which occurred at frequent intervals but the offices of postmaster and first sheriff were attached to the meraly so that he managed both the messenger service service and the watch these were the only sh services

          
          42:02
          and The Messengers were the most numerous and much the busier of the two by no means all Hobbits were lettered but those who were wrote constantly to all their friends and a selection of their relations who lived further off than an afternoon's walk the sheriffs was the name that the hobbits gave to their police or the nearest equivalent that they possessed they had of of course no uniforms such things being quite unknown only a feather in their caps and they were in practice rather haywards than policemen

          more concerned with a strin of beasts than of people there were in all the Sha only 12 of them three in each Farthing for inside work a rather larger body varying at need was employed to beat the bounds and to see that Outsiders of any kind great or small did not make themselves a nuisance at the time when this Story begins the bounders as they were called had been greatly increased there were many reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures prowling about the borders or over them the first signed

          
          43:16
          that all was not quite as it should be and always had been except in Tales and legends of long ago few heeded the sign and not even Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended 60 years had passed since he set out on his memorable journey and he was old even for Hobbits who reached a hundred as often as not but much evidently still remained of the considerable wealth that he had brought back how much or how little he revealed to No One not even to Frodo his favorite nephew and he still kept secret the ring

          
          43:54
          that he had found four of the finding of the ring as is told in The Hobbit There came one day to Bilbo's door the great wizard Gandalf the gay and 13 dwarves with him none other indeed than Thor in Oaken Shield descendant of kings and his 12 companions in Exile with them he set out to his own lasting astonishment on a morning of April it being then the year 1341 sh Reckoning on a quest of great treasure the dwarf hordes of the Kings Under the Mountain beneath arore in Dale far off in the East the quest was successful and the

          
          44:44
          dragon that guarded The Horde was destroyed yet though before all was one the Battle of Five Armies was fought and Thorin was slain and many Deeds of renown were done the matter would scarcely have concerned later history or earned more than a note in the long annals of the third age but for an accident by the way the party was assailed by Orcs in a high pass of the Misty Mountains as they went towards wilderland and so it happened that Bilbo was lost for a while in the black orc mines deep under the

          
          45:18
          mountains and there as he groped in vain in the dark he put his hand on a ring lying on the floor of a tunnel he put it in in his pocket it seemed then like mere luck trying to find his way out Bilbo went on down to the roots of the mountains until he could go no further at the bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light and on an island of rock in the water lived Gollum he was a loathsome little creature he paddled a small boat with his large flat feet peering with pale luminous eyes and catching Blind Fish

          
          45:56
          with long fingers and eating them raw he ate any living thing even orc if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle he possessed a secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago when he lived still in the light a ring of gold that made its wearer invisible it was the one thing he loved his precious and he talked to it even when it was not with him for he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his Island except when he was hunted or spying on the Orcs of the mines maybe he would have attacked Bilbo

          
          46:33
          at once if the ring had been on him when they met but it was not and The Hobbit held in his hand an Elish knife which served him as a sword so to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the riddle game saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not guess then he would kill him and eat him but if Bilbo defeated him then he would do as Bill wished he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels since he was lost in the dark without hope and could neither go on nor back Bilbo accepted the challenge

          
          47:09
          and they asked one another many Riddles In the End Bilbo won the game more by luck as it seemed than by wits for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask and cried out as his hand Came Upon the ring he had picked up and forgotten what have I got in my pocket this Gollum failed to answer though he demanded three guesses the authorities it is true differ whether this last question was a mere question and not a riddle according to the strict rules of the game but all agree that after accepting it and trying

          
          47:47
          to guess the answer Gollum was bound by his promise and Bilbo pressed him to keep his word for the thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false even though such promises were held sacred and of old all but the wickedest things feared to break them but after ages alone in the dark gollum's heart was black and treachery was in it he slipped away and returned to his island of which Bilbo knew nothing not far off in the Dark Water there he thought lay his ring he was hungry now and angry and once his

          
          48:27
          precious was with him he would not fear any weapon at all but the ring was not on the island he had lost it it was gone his Screech sent a shiver down Bilbo's back though he did not yet understand what had happened but Gollum had at last leaped to a guess too late what has it got in its pocket he cried the light in his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder The Hobbit and recover his precious just in time Bilbo saw his Peril and he fled blindly up the passage away from the water and once more he was

          
          49:08
          saved by his luck for as he ran he put his hand in his pocket and the ring slipped quietly onto his finger so it was that Gollum passed him without seeing him and went on to guard the way out lest the thief should Escape wearily Bilbo followed him as he he went along cursing and talking to himself about his precious from which Talk At Last even Bilbo guessed the truth and Hope Came to him in the darkness he himself had found the marvelous ring and a chance of escape from the Orcs And from golum at length they came to a halt

          
          49:47
          before an unseen opening that led to the lower Gates of the mines on the Eastward side of the mountains there Gollum crouched at Bay smelling and listening and Bilbo was tempted to slay him with a sword but pity stayed him and though he kept the ring in which his only hope lay he would not use it to help him kill The Wretched creature at a disadvantage in the end Gathering his courage he leapt over Gollum in the dark and fled away down the passage pursued by his enemies cries of hate and despair

          
          50:24
          thief thief beins we hatte it forever now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told it to his companions to them his account was that Gollum had promised to give him a present if he won the game but when Gollum went to fetch it from his Island he found the treasure was gone a magic ring which had been given to him long ago on his birthday Bilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had found and as he had won the game it was already his by right but being in a tight place he said

          
          51:05
          nothing about it and made Gollum show him the way out as a reward instead of a present this account Bilbo set down in his Memoirs and he seems never to have altered it himself not even after the Council of Elon evidently it still appeared in the original red book as it did in several of the copies and abstracts but many copies contain the true account as an alternative derived no doubt from notes by Frodo or Sam WIS both of whom learned the truth though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually

          
          51:42
          written by the old Hobbit himself gandal however disbelieved Bilbo's first story as soon as he heard it and he continued to be very curious about the ring eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning which for a while strained their friendship that the wizard seemed to think the truth important though he did not say so to Bilbo he also thought it important and disturbing to find that the good Hobbit had not told the truth from the first quite contrary to his habit the idea of

          
          52:20
          a present Was Not Mere hobbit-like invention all the same it was suggested to Bilbo as he confessed by gollum's talk that he overheard for Gollum did in fact call the ring his birthday present many times that also gandal thought strange and suspicious but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years as will be seen in this book of Bilbo's later Adventures little more need be said here with the help of the Ring he escaped from the orc guards at the gate and rejoined his companions

          
          52:57
          he used the ring many times on his quest chiefly for the help of his friends but he kept it secret from them as long as he could after his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone save gandal and Frodo and no one else in the Sha knew of its existence or so he believed only to Frodo did he show the account of his journey that he was writing his sword sting Bilbo hung over his fireplace and his coat of marvelous mail the gift of the dwarves from The Dragon horde he lent to a museum to the

          54:22
          part played by the hobbits in the great events that led to the inclusion of the Sha in the re United Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history and many of their Traditions up to that time still mainly oral were collected and written down the greater families were also concerned with events in the Kingdom at large and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legends by the end of the first century of the 4th age there were already to be found in the Sha several libraries that

          
          54:55
          contained many historical books and Records the largest of these collections were probably at under Towers at great smiles and at Brandy Hall this account of the end of the third age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of West March that most important source for the history of the W of the Ring was soall because it was long preserved at undertow the home of the fair bands wardens of the West March it was in origin Bilbo's private diary which he took with him to rivendel Frodo brought it back to the Sha

          
          55:32
          together with many loose leaves of notes and during sh Reckoning 1420 21 he nearly filled its pages with his account of the war but next to it and preserved with it probably in a single red case were the three large volumes Bound in red leather that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift to these four volumes there was added in West March of fifth containing commentaries genealogies and various other matter concerning The Hobbit members of the fellowship the original red book has not been preserved but many copies were made

          
          56:12
          especially of the first volume for the use of the descendants of the children of Master Sam wiise the most important copy however has a different history it was kept at Great Smiles but it was written in Gondor probably at the request of the great grandson of pedrin and completed in sha Reckoning 1592 its Southern scribe appended this note fill King's writer finished this work in 4172 it is an exact copy in all details of the th's book in Min tith that book was a copy made at the request of King Alesa

          
          56:57
          of the r book of panth and was brought to him by the th perigrine when he retired to Gondor in 464 the th's book was thus the first copy made of the red book and contained much that was later omitted or lost in minus tith it received much annotation and many Corrections especially of names words and quotations in the Elvish languages and there was added to it an abbreviated version of those parts of the tale of Aragorn and Arwin which lie outside the account of the war the full tale is stated to have been written by

          
          57:35
          barahir grandson of the steward faramir sometime after the passing of the king but the chief importance of final's copy is that it alone contains the whole of Bilbo's translations from the Elish these three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which between 1403 and 188 he had used all the sources available to him in rivendel both living and written but since they were little used by Frodo being almost entirely concerned with the Elder days no more is said of them here since Mar Ardo and perigrine became

          the heads of their great families and at the same time kept up their connections with Rohan and Gondor the libraries at bucklebury and tuur contained much that did not appear in the red book in brandy Hall there were many Works dealing with arador and the history of Rohan some of these were composed or begun by mardok himself though in the Sha he was chiefly remembered for his herblore of the Sha and for his Reckoning of years in which he discussed the relation of the calendars of the Sha and Bri to those of rivendel Gondor and

          
          58:50
          Rohan he also wrote a short Treatise on Old words and names in the Sha showing special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the roim of such sh words as matham and old elements in place names at Great Smiles the books were of less interest to sholk though more important for larger history none of them was written by pedrin but he and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor mainly copies of summaries of histories or Legends relating to elendil and his

          
          59:25
          heirs only here in the Sha were to be found extensive materials for the history of numor and the arising of Sauron it was probably at Great Smiles that the tale of years was put together with the assistance of material collected by Mar OK though the dates given are often conjectural especially for the second age they deserve attention it is probable that mardock obtained assistance and information from rivendel which he visited more than once there though Elon had departed his sons long remained together with some of the

          unchanged would have been near of the mark there were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair that anyone should possess apparently Perpetual youth as well as reputedly inexhaustible wealth it will have to be paid for they said it isn't natural and trouble will come of it but so far trouble had not come and as Mr Baggins was generous with his money most people were willing to forgive him his Oddities and his Good Fortune he had remained on visiting

          terms with his relatives except of course the Sackville biners and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families but he had no close friends until some of his younger cousins began to grow up the eldest of these and Bilbo's favorite was young Frodo baggin when Bilbo was 99 he adopted Frodo as his Heir and brought him to live at Bag End and the hopes of the sackfield bag iners were finally dashed billbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday September the 22nd you would better cab leave here

          Frodo my lad said Bilbo one day and then we can celebrate our birthday parties comfortably together at that time Frodo was still in his twins as the hobbits called the irresponsible 20s between childhood and coming of age at 33 12 more years passed each year the biners had given very Lively combined birthday parties at bagend but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn Bilbo was going to be 111 1 1 1 a rather curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit the

          
          01:03:37
          old toque himself had only reached 130 and Frodo was going to be 33 33 an important number the date of his Coming of Age tongues began to wag in hobbiton and Bywater and rumor of the coming event traveled all over the sh the history and character of Mr Bilbo beggins became once again the chief topic of conversation and the older folks suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand no one had a more attentive audience than Old Ham gamji commonly known as the gaffer he held forth at the ivy Bush a small in on the Bywater Road

          
          01:04:23
          and he spoke with some Authority for he had tended the the Garden at bagin for 40 years and had helped old Holeman in the same job before that now that he was himself growing old and stiffen the joints the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son Sam gamji both Father and Son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo they lived on the hill itself in number three bagshot row just below Bag End a very nice well spoken G hit is Mr Bilbo as I've always said the gaffer declared with perfect Truth for Bilbo

          
          01:05:03
          was very polite to him calling him master hamast and Consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables in the matter of roots especially potatoes the gaffer was recognized as the leading Authority by all in the neighborhood including himself but what about this froo that lives with him asked old of Bywater bgins is his name but he's more than half a brandy Buck they say it beats me why any beggins of hiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland where folks are so queer and no wonder they're queer put in

          
          01:05:45
          daddy twof foot the gaffer's next door neighbor if they live on the wrong side of the Brandy Wine River and right again the Old Forest that's a bad place if half the tales be true you're right Dad said the gaffer not that the Brandy bucks of Buckland live in the forest but they're a queer breed seemingly they fool about with boats on that Big River and that isn't natural Small Wonder that trouble came of it I say but be that as it may Mr Frodo is As Nice a young Hobbit as you could wish to meet very much like Mr Bill

          
          01:06:26
          and in more than looks after all his father was a beggins a decent respectable hbit was Mr Doo beggins there was never much to tell of him till he was drowned drowned said several voices they had heard this and other darker rumors before of course but Hobbits have a passion for family history and they were ready to hear it again well so they say said the gaffer you see Mr Drogo he married poor Miss Prima Brandy Buck she was our Mr Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side her mother being the youngest of the old

          
          01:07:13
          tok's daughters and Mr Drogo was his second cousin so Mr Frodo is his first and second cousin once removed either way as the saying is if you follow for me and Mr Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law old Master garod do as he often did after his marriage him being partial to his vittles and old gber do keeping a mighty generous table and he went out boting on the Brandy Wine River and he and his wife were drowned and poor Mr Frodo only a child and all I've heard they went on the water

          
          01:07:56
          after dinner in the Moonlight said old noes and it was drogo's weight as sunk the boat and I heard she pushed him in and he pulled her in after him said sandim and the hobbiton Miller you shouldn't listen to all you hear sandyman said the gaffer who did not much like the Miller there isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble anyway there was this Mr Frodo left an orphan and Stranded as you might

          
          01:08:35
          say among those queer Buck Landers being brought up anyhow in brandy Hall a regular Warren by all accounts old Master gorod do never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place Mr Bilbo never did a Kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk but I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville bagginses they thought they were going to get bagend that time when he went off and was thought to be dead and then he comes back and orders them off and he goes on

          
          01:09:13
          living and living and never looking a day older bless him and suddenly he produces an air and has all the papers made out proper the Sackville Bing won't never see the inside of Bag End now or it is to be hoped not there's a tidy bit of money tuck the way up there I hear tell said a stranger a visitor on Business from Michel delving and the West faring all the top of your Hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver and jewels by what I've heard then you've heard more than I can

          
          01:09:54
          speak to answered the gaffer I know nothing about Jews Mr Bilbo is free with his money and there seems No Lack of it but I know of no tunnel making I saw Mr Bilbo when he came back a matter of 60 years ago when I was a lad I'd not long come Prentice to Old Holan him being my Dad's cousin but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapes sing All Over the Garden while the sail was on and in the middle of it all Mr Bilbo comes up the hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and

          
          01:10:35
          a couple of chests I don't doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign Parts where there be mountains of gold they say but there wasn't enough to fill tunnels but my lad Sam will know more about that he's in and out of Bag End crazy about stories of the old AG he is and he listens to all Mr Bilbo's Tails Mr Bilbo has learned him his letters meaning no harm Mark you and I hope no harm will come of it elves and Dragons I says to him cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you don't go getting mixed up in a

          
          01:11:16
          business of your betters or you'll land in trouble too big for you I says to him and I might say it to others he added with a look at the stranger and the Miller but the gaffer didn't convince his audience the legend of Bilbo's wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of Hobbits ah but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first argued the Miller voicing common opinion he's off and away from home and look at the outlandish folk that visit him dwarves coming at night and that old

          wandering country you're a Gandalf and all you can say what you like gav but bag in's a queer place and it's folk are queerer and you can say what you like about what you know no more of than you do of boating Mr sandyman retorted the gaffer disliking the Miller even more than usual if that's being queer then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts there's some not far away that wouldn't off for a point of beer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walls but they do things proper

          
          01:12:32
          at bagend our Sam says that everyone's going to be invited to the party and there's going to be presents Mar you presents for all this very month as is that very month was September and as fine as you could ask a day or two later a rumor probably started by the knowledgeable Sam was sprad about that there were going to be fireworks fireworks what is more such as had not been seen in the sh for n on a Century not indeed since the old toque died days passed and the day grew nearer an odd-looking wagon Laden with

          
          01:13:14
          odd-looking packages rolled into hobbiton one evening and toiled up the hill to Bag End the startled Hobbits peered out of lampl doors to gape at it it was was driven by outlandish folk singing strange songs TS with long beards and deep hoods a few of them remained at Bag End at the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandy Wine bridge in broad daylight an old man was driving it all alone he wore a tall pointed blue hat a long gray cloak and a silver scarf he

          
          01:13:53
          had a long white beard and Bush eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat small Hobbit children ran after the cart all through hobbiton and right up the hill it had a cargo of fireworks as they rightly guessed at Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes each labeled with a large red feanorian G and the elfun g that was gandar Mark of course and the old man was Gandalf the wizard whose Fame in the sh was due mainly to his

          
          01:14:32
          skill with fires smokes and lights his real business was far more difficult and dangerous but the sh folk knew nothing about it to them he was just one of the attractions at the party hence the excitement of The Hobbit children chief of brand they shouted and the old man smiled they knew him by sight though he only appeared in hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor any but the oldest of their Elders had seen one of his firework displays they now belonged to a legendary

          
          01:15:11
          past when the old man helped by Bilbo and some dwarves had finished unloading Bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a single squib or Cracker was forthcoming to the disappointment of the onlookers run away now said Gandalf you will get plenty when the time comes then he disappeared inside with Bilbo and the door was shut the young Hobbit stared at the door in vain for a while and then made off feeling that the day of the party would never come inside bagend Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a

          
          01:15:52
          small room looking out west onto the Garden the late afternoon was bright and peaceful the flowers glowed red and golden Snap Dragons and sunflowers and nans trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows how bright your garden looks said Gandalf yes said Bilbo I am very fond indeed of it and of all the dear old Sha but I think I need a holiday you mean to go on with your plan then I do I made up my mind months ago and I haven't changed it very well it is no good saying anymore stick to your plan

          
          01:16:38
          your whole plan mind and I hope it will turn out for the best for you and for all of us I hope so anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday and have my little joke who will laugh I wonder said Gandalf shaking his head we shall see said Bilbo the next day more carts rolled up the hill and still more carts there might have been some grumbling about dealing locally but that very week orders began to pour out of bagend for every kind of provision commodity or luxury that could be obtained in hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the

          
          01:17:23
          neighborhood people became enthusiastic and they began to tick off the days on the calendar and they watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invitations before long the invitations began pouring out and the hobbiton post office was blocked and the Bywater post office was snowed under and voluntary assistant postmen were called for there was a constant stream of them going up the hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you you I shall certainly come a notice appeared on the gate at

          
          01:18:00
          Bag End no admittance except on party business even those who had or pretended to have party business were seldom allowed inside billbo was busy writing invitations ticking off answers packing up presents and making some private preparations of his own from the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from View one morning the hobbits woke to find the large Field South of Bilbo's front door covered with ropes and poles for tents and Pavilions a special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road and

          
          01:18:41
          wide steps and a large white gate were built there the three Hobbit families of bagshot row adjoining the field were intensely interested and generally envied old gaffa gamji stopped even pretending to work in his garden the tents began to go up there was a specially large Pavilion so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it and stood proudly near one end at the head of the chief table lanterns were hung on all its branches more promising still to the hobbit's mind an enormous open air kitchen was

          
          01:19:21
          erected in the north corner of the field a draft of Cooks from every Inn and eating house for miles around arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were caughted at Bag End excitement Rose to its height then the weather clouded over that was on Wednesday the eve of the party anxiety was intense then Thursday September the 22nd actually dawned the sun got up the clouds vanished flags were unfurled and the fun began Bilbo baggin called it a party but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one

          
          01:20:08
          practically everybody living near was invited a very few were overlooked by accident but as they turned up all the same that didn't matter many people from other parts of the sh were also asked and there were even a few from outside the borders Bilbo met the guests and additions at the new White gate in person he gave away presents to all and Sury the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays not very expensive

          
          01:20:44
          ones as a rule and not so lavishly as on this occasion but it was not a bad system actually in hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was some body's birthday so that every Hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week but they never got tired of them on this occasion the presents were unusually good The Hobbit children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating there were toys the like of which they had never seen before all beautiful and some obviously

          
          01:21:21
          magical many of them had indeed been ordered a year before and had come all the way from the mountain and from Dale and were a real dwarf make when every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate there were songs dances music games and of course food and drink there were three official meals lunch tea and dinner or supper but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together at other times there were merely lots of people eating and

          
          01:22:00
          drinking continuously from 11 until 6:30 when the fireworks started the fireworks were by Gandalf they were not only brought by him but designed and made by him and the special effects set pieces and flights of rockets were let off by him but there was also a generous distribution of squibs crackers backa rappers sparklers torches dwarf candles elf fountains Goblin barkers and thunder claps they were all superb the art of Gandalf improved with age there were Rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet

          
          01:22:44
          voices there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished Hobbits disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces there were Fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees there were pillars of colored fires that Rose and turned into Eagles or sailing ships or a fance of flying swans there was a red thunderstorm and a

          
          01:23:17
          shower of Yellow Rain there was a forest of silver Spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army and came down again into the water with a hiss like a hund hot snakes and there was also one last surprise in honor of Bilbo and it startled the hobbits exceedingly as Gandalf intended the lights went out a great smoke went up it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance and began to Glow at the summit it spouted green and Scarlet Flames out flew a red Golden Dragon not life-size but terribly

          
          01:23:58
          lifelike fire came from his Jaws his eyes glared down there was a Roar and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd they all ducked and many fell flat on their faces the dragon passed like an Express train turned to somersault and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion that is the signal for supper said Bilbo the pain and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate Hobbits leapt to their feet there was a splendid supper for everyone for everyone that is except those invited to the special

          
          01:24:35
          family dinner party this was held in the great Pavilion with a tree the invitations were limited to 12 dozen a number also called by the hobbits one gross though the word was not considered proper to use of people and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and fro were related with the addition of a few special unrelated friends such as Gandalf many young Hobbits were included and present by parental permission for Hobbits were easy going with their children in the matter of sitting up

          
          01:25:09
          late especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal bringing up young Hobbits took a lot of provender there were many bagginses and boffins and also many tokes and Brandy bucks there were various grubs relations of Bilbo Bean's grandmother and various chubs connections of his TK grandfather and a selection of barers bugers brace girdles Brock houses good bodies horn blowers and proud foots some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo and some had hardly ever been in hobbton before

          
          01:25:52
          as they lived in remote corners of the sh the Sackville baginas were not forgotten oo and his wife Lilia were present they disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo but so magnificent was the invitation card written in Golden Inc that they had felt it was impossible to refuse besides their cousin Bilbo had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high reputation all the one 144 guests expected a pleasant Feast though they rather dreaded the after dinner speech of their host an inevitable item he was liable to drag in

          
          01:26:36
          bits of what he called poetry and sometimes after a glass or to would allude to the Absurd Adventures of his mysterious Journey the guests were not disappointed they had a very pleasant feast in fact an engrossing entertainment Rich abundant varied and prolonged the purchase of Provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks but as Bilbo's catering had depleted the stocks of most of the stores Sellers and warehouses for miles around that didn't matter much after the feast more or less came

          
          01:27:16
          the speech most of the company were however now in a tolerant mood at that delightful stage which they called filling up the corners they were sipping their favorite drinks and nibbling at their favorite dainties and their fears were forgotten they were prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at every full stop my dear people began Bilbo rising in his place here they shouted and kept on repeating it in chorus seeming reluctant to follow their own advice Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair

          
          01:27:57
          under the illuminated tree the light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face the golden button shown on his embroidered silk waist coat they could all see him standing waving one hand in the air the other was in his trouser pocket my dear binges and buffins he began again and my dear tokes and Brandy bucks and grubs and and chubs and barrowes and horn blowers and bugers Brace girdles good buies Brock houses and proud foots proud feet shouted an elderly Hobbit from the back of the Pavilion his name of course was proud foot and well

          
          01:28:43
          merited his feet were large exceptionally furry and both were on the table proud foots repeated Bilbo also my good sackfield bingers that I welcome back at last to bagging today is my 111th birthday I am 111 today hooray hooray many happy returns they shouted and they hammered joyously on the tables Bilbo was doing splendidly this was the sort of stuff they liked short and obvious I we hope you're all enjoying yourselves as much as I am deafening cheers cries of yes and no noises of trumpets and horns pipes and flutes and

          
          01:29:36
          other musical instruments there were as has been said many young Hobbits present hundreds of musical trackers had been pulled most of them bore the mark Dale on them which did not convey much to most of the hobbits but they all agreed they were marvelous crackers they contained instruments small but of perfect make and enchanting tones indeed in one corner some of the young tkes and Brandy box supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished since he had plainly said all that was necessary now got up an impromptu Orchestra and

          
          01:30:13
          began a mer dance tune Master everard T and Miss melot brandbu got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vigorous but Bilbo had not finished seizing a horn from a youngster nearby he blew three loud Hoots the noise subsided I shall not keep you long he cried cheers from all the assembly I have called you all together for a purpose something in the way that he said this made an impression there was almost silence and one or two two of the

          
          01:30:54
          tokes pricked up their ears indeed for three purposes first of all to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all and that 111 years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits tremendous Outburst of approval I don't know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve this was unexpected and rather difficult there was some scattered clapping but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment secondly to celebrate my

          
          01:31:36
          birthday cheers again I should say our birthday for it is of course also the birthday of my Heir and nephew Frodo he comes of age and into his inheritance today some perun clapping by the Elder and some loud shouts of froo froo Jolly Old froo from the Juniors the Sackville binza scowled and wondered what was meant by coming into his inheritance together we score 144 your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total one gross if I may use the Expression no cheers this was ridiculous many of the guests and especially the

          
          01:32:28
          Sackville biners were insulted feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number like Goods in a package one gross indeed vulgar expression it is also if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history the anniversary of my Aral by battel at esgaroth on the Long Lake though the fact that it was my birthday birthday slipped my memory on that occasion I was only 51 then and birthdays didn't seem so important the banquet was very Splendid however though I had a bad cold at the time I remember and could only

          
          01:33:09
          say thank you very much I now repeat it more correctly thank you very much for coming to my little party obstinate silence they all feared that a song or some poetry was now in and they were getting bored why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health but Bilbo did not sing or a site he paused for a moment thirdly and finally he said I wish to make an announcement he spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone set up who still could I regret to announce that though as I said 111 years is far too

          
          01:33:58
          short a time to spend among you this is the end I am going I am leaving now good bye he stepped down and vanished there was a blinding flash of light and the guests all blinked when they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen 140 before flabbergasted Hobbit sat back speechless old Odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped then there was a dead silence until suddenly after several deep breaths every baggings bofin toque brandybuck grub chub barrows buer brace girdle Brock House good body Hornblower

          
          01:34:48
          and proudfoot began to talk at once it was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance he's mad I always said so was probably the most popular comment even the tokes with a few exceptions thought Bilbo's Behavior was absurd for the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank but old Rory brandyb was not so sure neither age not an enormous dinner had clouded his wits and he said to his

          
          01:35:28
          daughter-in-law Esmeralda there something fishy in this my dear I believe that mad Baggins is off again silly old fool but War worry he hasn't taken the vittles with him he called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing for some time he had said sat silently beside Bilbo's empty chair and ignored all remarks and questions he had enjoyed the joke of course even though he had been in the know he had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of

          
          01:36:08
          the guests but at the same time he felt deeply troubled he realized suddenly that he loved the old Hobbit dearly most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo bein's Oddities past and present but the sack bagginses had already departed in wroth Frodo didn't want to have any more to do with the party he gave orders for more wine to be served then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo and slipped out of the Pavilion as for Bilbo beggins even while he was making his

          
          01:36:47
          speech he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret for for so many years as he stepped down He Slipped it on his finger and he was never seen by any Hobbit in hobbiton again he walked briskly back to his hole and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the Pavilion and to the sounds of Merry making in other parts of the field then he went in he took off his party clothes folded up and wrapped in tissue paper his embroidered silk waste

          
          01:37:22
          coat and put it away then he put on quickly some old untidy garments and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt on it he hung a short sword in a battered black leather scaer from a locked drawer smelling of moth balls he took out an old cloak and Hood they had been locked up as if they were very precious but they were so patched and weather stained that their original color could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green they were rather too large for him he then went into his study and from a

          
          01:38:00
          large strong box took out a bundle wrapped in Old cloths and a leatherbound manuscript and also a large bulky envelope the book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly full into the envelope He Slipped his golden ring and its fine chain and then sealed it and addressed it to fro at first he put it on the mantle piece but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket at that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in hello said Bilbo I wondered if you'd

          
          01:38:42
          turn up I'm glad to find you visible replied the wizard sitting down in the chair I wanted to catch you and have a few final words I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly in according to plan yes I do said Bilbo though that flash was surprising it quite startled me let alone the others a little addition of your own I suppose it was you have wisely kept that ring secret all these years and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment

          
          01:39:24
          and would spoil my joke you are an interfering old Busy Body laughed Bilbo but I expect you know best as usual I do when I know anything but I don't feel too sure about this whole Affair it has now come to the final point you have had your joke and alarmed or offended most of your relations and given the whole sh something to talk about for 9 days or 99 more like are you going any further yes I am I feel I need a holiday a very long holiday as I've told you before probably a permanent holiday I don't expect I shall return in

          
          01:40:12
          fact I don't mean to and I have made all Arrangements I am old gandal I don't look it but I'm beginning to feel it in my Heart of Heart well preserved indeed he snorted why I feel all thin sort of stretched if you know what I mean like butter that has been scraped over too much bread that can't be right I need a change or something Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him no it does not seem right he said thoughtfully no after all I believe your plan is probably the best well well I've made up my mind

          
          01:40:55
          anyway I want to see mountains again Gandalf mountains and then find somewhere where I can rest in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying around and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell I might find somewhere where I can finish my book I have thought of a nice ending for it and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days Gandalf laughed I hope he will but nobody will read the book however it ends oh they may in years to come Frodo has read some already as far as it has gone you'll

          
          01:41:38
          keep an eye on Frodo won't you yes I will two eyes as often as I can spare them he would come with me of course if I asked him in fact he offered to once just before the party but he doesn't really want to yet I want to see the Wild Country again before I die and the mountains but he's still in love with a sh with woods and Fields and little Rivers he ought to be comfortable here I'm leaving everything to him of course except a few oddments I hope he'll be happy when he gets used to being on his

          
          01:42:18
          own it's time he was his own Master now everything said Gandalf the ring as well you agreed to that you remember well uh yes I suppose so stammered Bilbo where is it in an envelope if you must know said Bilbo impatiently there on the mantle piece well no here it is in my pocket he hesitated isn't that odd now he said softly to himself yet after all why not why shouldn't it stay there Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo and there was a gleam in his eyes I think Bilbo he said quietly I should leave it behind don't you want

          
          01:43:11
          to well yes and no now it comes to it I don't like parting with it at all I may say and I don't really see why I should why do do you want me to he asked and a curious change came over his voice it was sharp with suspicion and annoyance you always badgering me about my ring but you've never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey no but I had to Badger you said Gandalf I wanted the truth it was important magic rings are well magical and they are rare and curious I was professionally

          
          01:43:50
          interested in your ring you may say and I still am I should like to know where it is if you go wandering again also I think you have had it quite long enough you won't need it anymore Bilbo unless I'm quite mistaken Bilbo flushed and there was an angry light in his eyes his kindly face grew hard why not he cried and what business is it of yours anyway to know what I do with my own things it is my own I found it it came to me yes yes said Gandalf but there is no need to get angry if I am it is your fault said

          
          01:44:30
          Bilbo it is mine I tell you my own my precious yes my precious the Wizard's face remained grave and attentive and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed it has been called that before he said but not by you but I say it now and why not even if Gollum said the same once it's not his now but mine and I shall keep it I say gandaf stood up he spoke sternly you will be a fool if you do Bilbo he said you make that clearer with every word you say it has got far too

          
          01:45:13
          much hold on you let it go and then you can go yourself and be free I'll do as I choose and go as I please said Bilbo obstinately now now my dear Hobbit said Gandalf all your life we have been friends and you owe me something C do as you promised give it up well if you want my ring yourself say so cried Bilbo but you won't get it I won't give my precious away I tell you his hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword Gandalf's eyes flashed it will be my turn to get angry soon he said if you say that again I

          
          01:45:54
          shall then you will see Gandalf the Gray uncloaked he took a step toward the Hobbit and he seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow filled the little room Bilbo backed away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his pocket they stood for a while facing one another and the air of the room tingled Gandalf's eyes remained Bent On The Hobbit slowly his hands relaxed and he began to tremble I don't know what has come over you Gandalf he said you've never been like this before what's it all about it is

          
          01:46:32
          mine isn't it I found it and Gollum would have killed me if I hadn't kept it I'm not a thief whatever he said I've never called you one gandaf answered and I'm not one either I'm not trying to rob you but to help you I wish you'd trust me as you used he turned away and the shadow passed he seemed to dwindle again to an old gray man bent and troubled Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes I am sorry he said but I felt so queer and yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it anymore it has been so

          
          01:47:15
          growing on my mind lately sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me I always wanting to put it on and disappear don't you know wondering if it's safe and pulling it out to make sure I tried locking it up but I found I couldn't rest without it in my pocket I don't know why and I don't seem able to make up my mind then trust mine said Gandalf it's quite made up go away and leave it behind stop possessing it give it to Frodo and I will look after him Bilbo stood for a moment tense and

          
          01:47:59
          undecided presently he side all right he said with an effort I will then he Shrugged his shoulders and smiled rather rofy after all that's what this party business was all about really to give away lots of birthday presents and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time it hasn't made it any easier in the end but it would be a Pity to waste all my preparations it would quite spoil a joke indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair said Gandalf very well said bilbur it goes to

          
          01:48:43
          Frodo with all the rest he drew a deep breath but now I really must be starting or somebody else will catch me I've seen said goodbye and I couldn't bear to do it all over again he picked up his bag and moved to the door you have still got the ring in your pocket said the wizard well so I have cried Bilbo and my will and all the other documents too you'd better take it and deliver it for me that will be safest no don't give the ring to me said Gandalf put it on the mantle piece it will be safe enough

          
          01:49:24
          there till Frodo comes I shall wait for him Bilbo took out the envelope but just as he was about to set it by the clock his hand jerked back and the packet fell on the floor before he could pick it up the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place a spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit's face again suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh well that's that he said now I'm off they went out into the Hall Bilbo chose his favorite stick from the stand then he whistled three dwarves came out

          
          01:50:08
          of different rooms where they had been busy is everything ready asked Bilbo everything packed and labeled everything they answered well let's start then he stepped out of the front door it was a fine night and the black sky was dotted with stars he looked up sniffing the air what fun what fun to be off again off on the road with dwarves this is what I've really been longing for for years goodbye he said looking at his old home and bowing to the door goodbye Gandalf goodbye for the present Bilbo

          
          01:50:52
          take take care of yourself you're old enough and perhaps wise enough take care I don't care don't you worry about me I'm as happy now as I've ever been and that is saying a great deal but the time has come I'm being swept off my feet at last he added and then in a low voice as if to himself he sang softly in the dark the road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began now far ahead the road has gone and I must follow if I can pursuing it with eager feet until it joins some larger way where many paths

          
          01:51:38
          and erands meet and with then I cannot say he paused silent for a moment then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the fields and and followed by his three companions went round into his garden and trotted Down The Long sloping path he jumped over a low place in the Hedge at the bottom and took to The Meadows passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness goodbye my dear Bilbo until our next meeting he said softly and went

          
          01:52:22
          back indoors Frodo came in soon afterwards and found him sitting in the dark deep in thought has he gone he asked yes answered Gandalf he's gone at last I wish I mean I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke said Frodo but I knew in my heart that he really meant to go he always used to joke about serious things I wish I'd come back sooner just to see him off I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end said Gandalf don't be too troubled he'll be all right no he'll have a pack it for you there it

          
          01:53:12
          is Frodo took the envelope from the mantlepiece and glanced at it but did not open it you'll find his will and all the other documents in there I think said the wizard you are the master of bagend N and also I fancy you'll find a Golden Ring The Ring exclaimed Frodo has he left me that I wonder why still it may be useful it may and it may not said gandaf I should not make use of it if I were you but keep it secret secret and keep it safe now I'm going to bed as master of bagend Frodo felt it his painful duty to say goodbye to the

          
          01:54:04
          guests rumors of strange events had by now spread all over the field but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning about midnight carriages came for the important folk one by one they rolled away filled with full but very unsatisfied Hobbits gardeners came by Arrangement and removed in wheelbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind night slowly passed the sun rose the hobbits Rose rather later morning went on people came and began by orders to clear away The

          
          01:54:48
          Pavilions and the tables and the chairs and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper the forgott bags and gloves and handkerchiefs and the uneaten food a very small item then a number of other people came without orders baginas and boffins and bugers and tkes and other guests that lived or were staying near by midday when even the best fed were out and about out again there was a large crowd at Bag End Uninvited but not

          
          01:55:29
          unexpected Frodo was waiting on the step smiling but looking rather tired and worried he welcomed all the callers but he hadn't much more to say than before his reply to all inquiries was simply this Mr Bilbo bgins has gone away as far as I know for good some of the visitors he invited to come inside as Bilbo had left messages for them inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture on every item there was a label tied there were several labels of this

          
          01:56:11
          sort for adelard took for his very own from Bilbo on an umbrella adelard had carried off many unlabeled ones for daughter bgins in memory of a long correspondence with love from Bilbo on a large waist paper basket Dora was drogo's sister and Elder surviving female relative of Bilbo and froda she was 99 and had written Rams of good advice for more than half a century for Milo Burrows hoping it will be useful from BB on a go old ped and ink bottle Milo never answered letters Ford Angelica's use from Uncle

          Bilbo on a round convex mirror she was a young Baggins and to obviously considered her face shapely for the collection of Hugo brace girdle from a contributor on an empty bookcase Hugo was a great borrower of books and worse than usual at returning them follow beia Sackville Baggins as a present on a case of Silver Spoons billbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons while he was away on his former Journey leelan knew that quite well when she arrived later in the day she took the point at

          
          01:57:43
          once but she also took the spoons this is only a small selection of the assembled presence Bilbo's residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life it was a tendency of hobbi holes to get cluttered up for which the custom of giving so many birthday presents was largely responsible not of course that the birthday presents were always new there were one or two old maths of Forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district but Bilbo had usually given new presents and kept the those that he

          
          01:58:23
          received the old hole was now being cleared a little every one of the various parting gifts had labels written out personally by Bilbo and several had some point or some joke but of course most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome the poorer Hobbits and especially those of bagshot row did very well old gaffa gamji got two sacks of potatoes a new spade a Woolen waste coat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints old Rory brandybuck in return for much Hospitality got a dozen

          
          01:59:05
          bottles of old wyards a strong red wine from the south Farthing and now quite mature as it had been laid down by Bilbo's father Rory quite forgave Bilbo and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle there was plenty of everything left for Frodo and of course all the chief Treasures as well as the books pictures and more than enough Furniture were left in his possession there was however no sign nor mention of money or jewelry not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away Frodo had a very trying time that

          
          01:59:48
          afternoon a false rumor that the whole household was being distributed had free spread like wildfire and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there but couldn't be kept out labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcuffs in the middle of the commotion

          
          02:00:22
          the Sackville Baggins has arrived Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Mery brandybuck to keep an eye on things when oo loudly demanded to see Frodo Mary bowed politely he is indisposed he said he is resting hiding you mean said liilia anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him just go and tell him so Mary left them a long while in the hall and they had time to discover their Parting Gift of SP WS it did not improve their tempers eventually they were shown into the study Frodo was

          
          02:00:58
          sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him he looked indisposed to see the Saville bingers at any rate and he stood up fidgeting with something in his pocket but he spoke quite politely the Sackville Baggins were rather offensive they began by offering him bad bargain prices as between friends for various valuable and unlabeled things when Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away they said the whole Affair was very fishy only one thing is clear

          
          02:01:34
          to me said oor and that is that you were doing exceedingly well out of it I insist on seeing the will oo would have been Bilbo's a but for the adoption of Frodo he read the will carefully and snorted it was unfortunately very clear and correct according to the legal customs of Hobbits which demand among other things seven signatures of Witnesses in red ink foiled again he said to his wife and after waiting 60 years spoons figle sticks he snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and stumped off but liilia was not so easily got rid

          
          02:02:16
          of a little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place investigating nooks and corners and tapping the floors he escorted her firmly off the premises after he had relieved her of several small but rather valuable articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella her face looked as if she was in the throws of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all she found to say turning around on the step was you live to regret it young fellow

          
          02:02:50
          why didn't you go too you don't belong here you no beggins you you're a brandy Buck did you hear that Mar that was an insult if you like said Frodo as he shut the door on her it was a compliment said Mary brandyb and so of course not true then they went round the hole and evicted three young Hobbits two boffins and a Bulger who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellers Frodo also had a tussle with young Sano proudfoot old Odo proudfoot grandson who had begun an excavation in the larger

          
          02:03:31
          Pantry where he thought there was an echo the legend of Bill Bose's gold excited both curiosity and hope for legendary gold mysteriously obtained if not positively ill gotten is as everyone knows anyone's for the finding unless the search is interrupted when he had overcome Sano and pushed him out Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall it's time to close the shop Mary he said lock the door and don't open it to anyone today not even if they bring a battering ram then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of

          
          02:04:12
          tea he'd hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the front door liilia again most likely he thought she must have thought of something really nasty and have come back again to say it it can wait he went on with his tea the knock was repeated much louder but he took no notice suddenly the Wizard's head appeared at the window if you don't let me in Frodo I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said my dear Gandalf half a minute cried Frodo running out of the room to the door come

          
          02:04:52
          come in come in I thought it was liilia then I forgive you but I saw her some time ago driving a pony trap toward Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk she'd already nearly curdled me honestly I nearly tried on Bilbo's ring I longed to disappear don't do that said Gandalf sitting down do be careful of that ring Frodo in fact it's partly about that that I've come to say a last word well what about it what do you know already only what billbo told me I've heard His Story how he found it and how he used it on his

          
          02:05:34
          journey I mean which story I wonder said Gandalf oh not what he told the dwarves and put in his book said Frodo he told me the true story soon after I came to live here he said you had pested him till he told you so I had better know too no secrets between us Frodo he said but they are not to go any farther it's mine anyway that's interesting said Gandalf well what did you think of it all if you mean inventing all that about a present well I thought the true story much more likely but I couldn't see the point of

          
          02:06:15
          altering it at all it was very unlike Bilbo to do so anyway and I thought it rather odd so so did I but odd things may happen to people that have such Treasures if they use them let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it it may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to I don't understand said Frodo neither do I answered the wizard I've merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night no need to worry but if you take my advice you will use it very

          
          02:06:51
          seldom or not at all at least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or Rouse suspicion I say again keep it safe and keep it secret you are very mysterious what are you afraid of I'm not certain so I will say no more I may be able to tell you something when I come back I'm going off at once so this is goodbye for the present he got up at once cried Frodo why I thought you were staying on for at least a week I was looking forward to your help I didn't mean to but I've had to change my mind I

          
          02:07:33
          may be away for a good while but I'll come and see you again as soon as I can expect me when you see me I shall slip in quietly I sh often be visiting the sh openly again I find that I have become rather unpopular they say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace some people are actually accusing me of spiting Bilbo away or worse if you want to know there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth some people exclaimed Frodo you mean oo and liilia how abominable I would give them bagend

          
          02:08:15
          and everything else if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him I love the sh but I begin to wish somehow that I'd gone too I wonder if I shall ever see him again so do I said Gandalf and I wonder many other things goodbye now take care of yourself look out for me especially at unlikely times goodbye Frodo saw him to the door he gave a final wave of his hand and walked off at a surprising pace but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a

          
          02:08:57
          great weight the evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the Twilight Frodo did not see him again for a long time chapter 2 the shadow of the past the talk didn't die down in 9 or even 99 days the second disappearance of Mr Bilbo Baggins was discussed in hobbiton and indeed all over the sh for a year and a day and was remembered much longer than that it became a Fireside story for young Hobbits and eventually mad Baggins who used to vanish with a bang and a Flash and reappear with bags of jewels

          
          02:09:41
          and gold became a favorite character of Legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten but in the meantime the General opinion in the neighborhood was that Bilbo who had always been rather cracked had at last gone quite mad and had run off into the blue there he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end the blame was mostly laid on Gandalf if only that dreaded wizard will leave young Frodo alone perhaps he'll settle down and grow some Hobbit

          
          02:10:16
          sense they said and to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone and he did settle down but the growth of Hobbit sense was not very noticeable indeed he had once began to carry on Bilbo's reputation for oddity he refused to go into bouring and the next year he gave a party in honor of Bilbo's 112th birthday which he called aund weight Feast but that was short of the mark for 20 guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rined drink as Hobbits say some people were

          
          02:10:52
          rather shocked but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo's birthday party year after year until they got used to it he said that he did not think Bilbo was dead when they asked where is he then he Shrugged his shoulders he lived alone as Bilbo had done but he had a good many friends especially among the younger Hobbits mostly descendants of the old TK who had as children been of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End Falco bofin and Fred Galer were two of these but his closest friends were perigrine Tuk usually

          
          02:11:31
          called Pippen and Mary bryu his real name was maradok but that was seldom remembered Frodo went tramping over the sh with them but more often he wandered by himself and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the Starlight Mary and Pippen suspected that he visited the elves at times as Bilbo had done as time went on people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good preservation outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic

          
          02:12:10
          Hobbit just out of his twins some folk have all the luck they said but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of 50 that they began to think it queer Frodo himself after the first chock found that being his own master and the Mr bagin of Bag End was rather Pleasant for some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future but half unknown to himself that regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing he found himself wondering at times especially in the

          
          02:12:48
          Autumn about the wildlands and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams he began to say to himself perhaps I shall cross the river myself one day to which the other half of his mind always replied not yet so it went on until his 40s were running out and his 50th birthday was drawing near 50 was a number that he felt was somehow significant or ominous it was at any rate at that age that Adventure had suddenly before Fallen Bilbo froda began to feel restless and the Old Paths seemed too well troden he

          
          02:13:29
          looked at maps and wondered what lay beyond their edges Maps made in the Sha showed mostly white spaces Beyond its borders he took to wandering further a field and More Often by himself and Mary and his other friends watched him anxiously often he was seen walking and talking with the strange Wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Sha there were rumors of strange things happening in the world outside and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years Frodo

          
          02:14:05
          gathered all the news he could elves who seldom walked in the sh could now be seen passing Westward through the woods in the evening passing and not returning but they were leaving Middle Earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles there were however dwarves on the road in unusual numbers the ancient east west road ran through the Sha to its end at the gray Havens and dwarves had always used it on their way to their minds in the Blue Mountains they were the hobbit's Chief source of news from distant Parts if

          
          02:14:40
          they wanted any as a rule dwares said little and Hobbits asked no more but now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries seeking refuge in the West they were troubled and some spoke in Whispers of the enemy and of the land of Mordor that name the Hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past like a shadow in the background of their memories but it was ominous and disquieting it seemed that the evil power in merkwood had been driven out by the white Council only to reappeared in Greater strength than the old

          
          02:15:17
          strongholds of Mordor The Dark Tower had been built it was said from there the power was spreading far and wide and Away far east and south there were Wars and growing fears Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains trolls were abroad no longer dull-witted but cunning and armed with Dreadful weapons and there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these but they had no name little of all this of course reached the ears of ordinary hbits but even the deafest and most stay- atome

          
          02:15:55
          began to hear queer tales and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things the conversation in the green dragon at Bywater one evening in the spring of Frodo's 50th year showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Sha rumors had been heard though most Hobbits still laughed at them Sam gamji was sitting in one corner near the fire and opposite him was Ted sanderman The Miller's son and there were various other rustic Hobbits listening to that talk queer things you do here these days

          
          02:16:30
          to be sure said Sam ah said Ted you do if you listen but I can hear Fireside tales and children's stories at home if I want to no doubt you can retorted Sam and I dare say there's more truth in some of them than you reckon who invented the stories anyway take dragons now no thanky said Ted I won't I heard tell of them when I was a Youngster but there's no call to believe in them now there's only one dragon in Bywater and that's green he said getting a general laugh all right said Sam laughing with a

          
          02:17:12
          rest but what about these tree men these Giants as you might call them they do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up Way Beyond the north Moors not long back whose day my cousin hell for one he works for Mr bofin at Overhill and goes up to the north farling for the hunting es saw one says he did perhaps your House's always saying he's seen things and maybe he sees things that ain't there but this one was as big as an elm tree and walking walking seven yards to a stride if it was an inch then I bet it

          
          02:17:53
          wasn't an inch what he saw was an elm tree as like as not but this one was walking I tell you and there ain't no Elm Tree on the North Moors then Al can't have seen one said Ted there was some laughter and clapping the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point all the same said Sam you can't deny that others besides our alast have seen queer folk crossing the sh Crossing it mind you there are more that have turned back at the borders the bounders have never been so busy before and I've

          
          02:18:31
          heard tell that elves are moving West they do say they are going to the harbors out Way Beyond the white towers Sam waved his arm vaguely neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea past the old Towers beyond the Western borders of the Sha but it was an old tradition that away over there stood the gray Havens from which at times Elven ship set sail never to return they are Sailing sailing sailing over the sea they are going into the west and leaving us said Sam half chanting the words shaking his head

          
          02:19:09
          sadly and solemnly but Ted laughed well that isn't anything new if you believe the old tales and I don't see what it matters to me or you let them sail but I warrant you haven't seen them doing it nor anyone else in the sh well I don't know said Sam thoughtfully he believed he had once seen an elf in the woods and still hoped to see more one day of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and half-remembered stories about the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him

          
          02:19:45
          most deeply there are some even in these parts as now the Fair folk and get news of them he said there's Mr bagins now that I work for he told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about elves and old Mr bbone knew more many's the talk I had with him when I was a little lad ah they're both cracked said Ted least ways old Bilbo was cracked and Frodo's cracking if that's where you get your news from you'll never want for moonshine well friends I off home your good health he drained his mug and went

          
          02:20:24
          out noisily Sam sat silent and said no more he had a good deal to think about for one thing there was a lot to do up in the Bag End Garden and he would have a busy day tomorrow if the weather cleared the grass was growing fast but Sam had more on his mind than gardening after a while he sighed and got up and went out it was early April and the sky was was now clearing after the Heavy Rain the sun was down and a cool pale evening was quietly Fading Into Night he walked home under the early Stars through

          
          02:21:02
          hobbiton and up the hill whistling softly and thoughtfully it was just at this time that gandal reappeared after his long absence for 3 years after the party he had been away then he paid Frodo a brief visit and after taking a good look at him he went off again during the next year or two he had turned up fairly often coming unexpectedly after Dusk and going off without warning Before Sunrise he would not discuss his own business and Journeys and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo's

          
          02:21:38
          health and doings then suddenly his visits had ceased it was over 9 years since Frodo had seen or heard of him and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in Hobbits but that evening as Sam was walking home and Twilight was fading there came the once familiar tap on the study window thodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great Delight they looked hard at one another all well said Gandalf you look the same as ever Frodo so do you froa replied but secretly he thought that

          
          02:22:19
          Gandalf looked older and more Carew born he pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world and soon they were deep in talk and they stayed up far into the night next morning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting with froda by the open window of the study a bright fire was on the Heth but the sun was warm and the wind was in the South everything looked fresh and the new green of spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees fingers Gandalf was thinking of a spring nearly

          
          02:22:54
          80 years before when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief his hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer and his face more lined with care and wisdom but his eyes were as bright as ever and he smoked and blew smoke rings with the same Vigor and Delight he was smoking now in silence but Frodo was sitting still deep in thought even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought at last he broke the

          
          02:23:29
          silence last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring Gandalf he said and then you stopped because you said that such matters were best left until daylight don't you think that you had better finish now you say the ring is dangerous far more dangerous than I guess in what ways in many ways answered the wizard it is far more powerful than I ever dared to think at first so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome any one of mortal race who possessed it it would possess him in

          
          02:24:02
          a regon long ago many Elven Rings were made magic rings as you call them and they were of course of various kinds some more potent and some less the Lesser Rings were only essays in the craft before it was full grown and to the Elven Smiths they were Trifles but still to my mind dangerous for Mortals but the great Rings the rings of power they were perilous a mortal Frodo who keeps one of the great rings does not die but it does not grow or obtain more life he merely continues until at last every minute is

          
          02:24:42
          a weariness and if he often uses the ring to make himself invisible he Fades he becomes in the end invisible permanently and walks in the Twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the Rings yes sooner or later later if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with but neither strength nor good purpose will last sooner or later the dark power will devour him how terrifying said Frodo there was another long silence the sound of Sam gamji cutting the lawn came in from the garden how how long have you known this

          
          02:25:22
          asked Frodo at length and how much did Bilbo know Bilbo knew no more than he told you I'm sure said Gandalf he would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger even though I promised to look after you he thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself he said that it was growing on his mind and he was always worrying about it but he didn't suspect that the ring itself was to blame though he had found out that the

          
          02:25:57
          thing needed looking after it didn't seem always of the same size or weight it shrank or expanded in an odd way and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight yes he warned me of that in his last letter said Frodo so I've always kept it on its chain very wise said Gandalf but as for his long life bill never connected it with the ring at all he took all the credit for that to himself and he was very proud of it though he was getting restless and uneasy thin and stretched he said a sign

          
          02:26:34
          that the ring was getting control how long have you known all this asked Frodo again known said Gandalf I've known much that only the wise know Frodo but if you mean known about this ring well I still do not know one might say there is a last test to make but I no longer doubt my guess when did I first begin to guess he mused searching back in his memory let me see it was in the year that the white Council drove the dark Power from merkwood Just Before the Battle of Five Armies that Bilbo found his ring a

          
          02:27:15
          shadow fell on my heart then though I didn't know yet what I feared I wondered often how Gollum came by a great ring as plainly it was that at least was clear from the first then I heard Bilbo's strange story of how he had won it and I couldn't believe it when I at last got the truth out of him I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring Beyond a doubt much like Gollum with his birthday present the lies were too much alike for my comfort clearly the ring had an UNH wholesome power that

          
          02:27:50
          said to work on its Keeper at once that was the first real warning I had that all was not well I told Bilbo often that such Rings were better left unused but he resented it and soon got angry there was little else that I could do I could not take it from him without doing greater harm and I had no right to do so anyway I could only watch and wait I might perhaps have consulted Saron the white but something always held me back who is he asked Frodo I've never heard of him before maybe not answered Gandalf

          
          02:28:29
          Hobbits are or were no concern of his yet he is great among the wise he is the chief of my order and the head of the council his knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with it and he takes ill any meddling the lord of the Elven Rings Great and Small is his Province his long uded it seeking the Lost secrets of their making but when the Rings were debated in the council all that he would reveal to us of his ring law told against my fears so my doubt slipped but uneasily still I watched and I waited

          
          02:29:07
          and all seemed well with Bilbo and the years passed yes they passed and they seemed not to touch him he showed no signs of age the shadow fell on me again but I said to myself after all he comes of a longlived family on his mother's side there is time yet wait and I waited until that night when he left this house he said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of seron could a lay I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work and I have spent most of the years since

          
          02:29:43
          then in finding out the truth of it there wasn't any permanent harm down was there asked Frodo anxiously he would get all right in time wouldn't he be able to rest in peace I mean he felt better at once said Gandalf but there is only one power in this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects and as far as I know there is no power in the world that knows all about Hobbits among the wise I am the only one that goes in for Hobbit law and obscure branch of knowledge but full of surprises soft as butter they can be and

          
          02:30:20
          yet some times as tough as old tree roots I think it likely that some would resist the Rings far longer than most of the wise would believe I don't think you need worry about Bilbo of course he possessed the ring for many years and used it so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off before it was safe for him to see it again for instance otherwise he might live on for years quite happily just stop as he was when he parted with it for he gave it up in the end of his own accord an important point no I was

          
          02:30:56
          not troubled about dear Bilbo anymore once he had let the thing go it is for you that I feel responsible ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you and about all these Charming absurd helpless Hobbits it would be a grievous blow to the world if the dark power overcame the sh if if all your kind Jolly stupid bugers horn blowers buffins brace girdles and the rest not to mention the ridiculous begginers became enslaved Frodo shuddered but why should we be he asked and why should he want such

          
          02:31:38
          slaves to tell you the truth replied Gandalf I believe that hither too hi too Mark you he has entirely overlooked the existence of Hobbits you should be thankful but your safety has passed he doesn't need you he has many more useful servants but he won't forget you again and Hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than Hobbits happy and free there is such a thing as malice and Revenge Revenge said Frodo revenge for what I still don't understand what all this has to do with Bilbo and myself

          
          02:32:17
          and our ring it has everything to do with it said Gandalf you don't know the real Peril yet but you shall I wasn't sure of it myself when I was last here but the time has come to speak give me the ring for a moment Frodo took it from his br's pocket where it was clasped to a chain that hung from his belt he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard it felt suddenly very heavy as if either it or Frodo himself was in some way Rel reluctant for Gandalf to touch it Gandalf held it up it looked to be made

          
          02:32:56
          of pure and solid gold can you see any markings on it he asked no said Frodo there are none it's quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear well then look to Frodo's astonishment and distress the wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the far Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongue but Gandalf held him back wait he said in a commanding voice giving Frodo a quick look from under his bristling brows no apparent change came over the ring after a while Gandalf got up closed

          
          02:33:34
          the shutters outside the window and Drew the curtains the room became dark and Silent though the Clack of Sam's shears now nearer to the windows could still be heard faintly from the garden for a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire then he stooped and removed the ring to the he with the tongs and at once picked it up Frodo gasped it is quite cool said Gandalf take it Frodo received it on his shrinking Palm it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever hold it up said Gandalf and look

          
          02:34:10
          closely as Frodo did so he now saw Fine Lines finer than the finest pen Strokes running along the ring outside side and inside lines of fire that seemed to form the letters of a flowing script they Shone piercingly bright and yet remote as if out of a great depth I cannot read the fiery letters said Frodo in a quavering voice no said Gandalf but I can the letters are Elvish of an ancient mode but the language is that of moror which I will not utter here but this in the common tongue is what is said close enough one ring to

          
          02:34:53
          rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them it is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven La three rings for the Elven Kings under the sky seven for the dwarf Lords in their Halls of stone nine for Mortal men doomed to die one for the dark lord on his dark thrown in the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie one ring to rule them all one ring to find them wondering to bring them all and in the darkness bind them in the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie he paused and then said

          
          02:35:38
          slowly in a deep voice this is the Master Ring the one ring to rule them all this is the one ring that he lost many ages ago to the great weakening of his power he greatly desires it but he must not get it Frodo sat silent and motionless fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf him this ring he stammered how how on Earth did it come to me ah said gendal that is a very long story the beginnings lie back in the black years which only the law Masters

          
          02:36:21
          now remember if I were to tell you all that tale we should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter but last night I told you of sa and the great the dark lord the rumors that you have heard are true he has indeed risen again and left his hold in merkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark Tower of moror that name even you Hobbits have heard of like a shadow on the borders of old stories always after defeat and a respit the shadow takes another shape and grows again I wish it need not have happened

          
          02:36:59
          in my time said Frodo so do I said Gandalf and so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us and already Frodo our time is beginning to look black the enemy is fast becoming very strong his plans are far from Ripe I think but they are ripening we shall be hard put to it we should be very hard put to it even if it were not for this Dreadful chance the enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to

          
          02:37:38
          beat down all resistance break the last defenses and cover all the lands in a second Darkness he lacks the One Ring the three fairest of all the elf Lords hid from him and his hand never touched them or sulled them seven the dwarf Kings possessed but three he has recovered and the others the dragons have consumed nine he gave to Mortal men proud and great and so ens snared them long ago they fell under the Dominion of the one and they became ring raids Shadows under his great Shadow His most terrible servants long ago

          
          02:38:20
          it is many a year since the nine walked abroad yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may walk again but come we will not speak of such things even in the morning of the Sha so it is now the nine he has gathered to himself the seven also or else they are destroyed the three are hidden still but that no longer troubles him he only needs the one for he made that ring himself it is his and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it so that he could rule all the others if he recovers it then he will

          
          02:39:04
          command them all again wherever they be even the three and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare and he will be stronger than ever and this is the Dreadful chance Frodo he believed that the one had perished that the elves had destroyed it as should have been done but he knows now that it has not perished that it has been found so he is seeking it seeking it and all his thought is bent on it it is his great hope and our great fear why why wasn't it destroyed cried Frodo and how did the enemy ever come to

          
          02:39:46
          lose it if he was so strong and it was so precious to him he clutched the ring in his hand as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize it it was taken from him said Gandalf the strength of the elves to resist him was greater long ago and not all men were estranged from them the men of westernness came to their aid that is a chapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall for there was sorrow then too and Gathering dark but great Valor and great Deeds that were not wholly Vain One day

          
          02:40:23
          perhaps I will tell you all the tale or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best but for the moment since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you and that will Beil enough this is all that I will say it was Gil galled elen King and elendil of westernness who overthrew siren though they themselves perished in the deed and isor elendil's Son cut the ring from sain's hand and took it for his own then saurin was vanquished and his Spirit fled and was hidden for long years until his shadow

          
          02:41:02
          took shape again in merkwood but the ring was lost it fell into the Great River andwin and vanished for isor was marching North along the east banks of the river and near the gladdened fields he was waylaid by the orc of the mountains and almost all his folk were slain he leapt into the waters but the ring slipped from his finger as he swam and then the orc saw him and killed him with arrows Gandalf paused and there in the dark pools amid the gladdened fields he said the ring passed out of knowledge

          
          02:41:40
          and Legend and even so much of its history is known now only to a few and the Council of the wise could discover no more but at last I can carry on the story I think long after but still very long ago there lived by the banks of the Great River on the edge of wilderland a clever handed and quiet footed little people I guess they were of Hobbit kind akin to the fathers of the fathers of the stores for they loved the river and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds there were among them a family of high

          
          02:42:19
          cute thought it was large and wealthier than most and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk Stern and wise in Old Law such as they had the most inquisitive and curious minded of that family was called smeagle he was interested in Roots and Beginnings he dived into deep pools he bed under trees and growing plants he tunneled into green mounds and he ceased to look up at the hilltops or the leaves on trees or the flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes went downward he had a friend called deagle

          
          02:42:56
          of similar sort sharper eyed but not so quick and strong on a time they took a boat and went down to the gladdened fields where there were great beds of Iris and flowering Reeds there smeagle got out and went nosing about the banks but deagle sat in the boat and fished suddenly a great fish took his hook and before he knew where he was he was dragged out and down into the water to the bottom then he let go of his line for he thought he saw something shining in the river bed and holding his breath

          
          02:43:30
          he grabbed at it then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank and behold when he washed the mud away there in his handly a beautiful golden ring and it Shawn and glittered in the Sun so that his heart was GL but smeagle had been watching him from behind a tree and as deagle gloated over the ring smeagle came up softly behind give us that teagle my love said smeagle over his friend's shoulder why said deagle because it's my birthday my love and I want it said spegel I don't

          
          02:44:14
          care said deagle I have given you a present already more than I could Ford I found this and I'm going to keep it oh are you indeed my love said smeagle and he caught deagle by the throat and strangled him because the gold looked so bright and beautiful then he put the ring on his finger no one ever found out what had become of deagle he was murdered far from home and his body was cunningly hidden but smeagle returned alone and he found that none of his family could see him when he was wearing the ring he was

          
          02:44:51
          very pleased with his Discovery and he concealed it and he used it to find out secrets and he put his knowledge to Crooked and malicious uses he became sharp eyed and Keen eared for all that was hurtful the ring had given him power according to his statue it is not to be wondered that that he became very unpopular and was shunned when visible by all his relations they kicked him and he bit their feet he took to thieving and going about muttering to himself and gurgling in his throat so they called

          
          02:45:26
          him colum and cursed him and told him to go far away and his grandmother Desiring peace expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole he wandered in loneliness weeping a little for the hardness of the world and he journeyed up the river till he came to a stream that flowed down from the mountains and he went that way he caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw one day it was very hot and as he was bending over a pool he felt a burning on the back of his head and a

          
          02:46:03
          dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her but as he lowered his eyes he saw far ahe head the tops of the Misty Mountains out of which the stream came and he thought suddenly it would be cool and Shady under those mountains the sun could not watch me there the roots of those mountains must be Roots indeed there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the

          
          02:46:42
          beginning so he journeyed By Night up into the highlands and he found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran and he wormed his way like a maggot Into the Heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge the Ring went into the Shadows with him and even the maker when his power had begun to grow again could learn nothing of it Gollum cried trodo Gollum do you mean that this is the very Gollum creature that Bilbo met how loome I think it is a sad story said the wizard and it might have happened to to

          
          02:47:19
          others even to some Hobbits that I have known I can't believe that Gollum was connected with Hobbits however distantly said Frodo with some heat what an abominable notion it is true all the same replied Gandalf about their Origins at any rate I know more than Hobbits do themselves and even Bilbo's story suggests the kinship there was a great deal in the background of their minds and memories that was very similar they understood one another remarkably well very much better than a hobbit would understand say a dwarf or an orc

          
          02:47:57
          or even an elf think of the riddles they both knew for one thing yes said Frodo though other folk beside Hobbits ask riddles and of much the same sort and Hobbits don't cheat Gollum meant to cheat all the time he was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard and I dare say it amused his wickedness to start again game which might end in providing him with an easy victim but if he lost would not hurt him only too true I fear said Gandalf but there was something else in it I think which you don't see

          
          02:48:33
          yet even Gollum was not wholly ruined he had proved tougher than even one of the wise would have guessed as a hobbit might there was a little corn out of his mind that was still his own and light came through it as through a in the dark light out of the past it was actually Pleasant I think to hear a kindly voice again bringing up memories of wind and trees and sun on the grass and such forgotten things but that of course would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end unless it could be conquered unless it could be cured

          
          02:49:14
          gandaf side alas there is little hope of that for him yet yet not no hope no not though he possessed the ring so long almost as far back as he can remember but it was long since he had worn it much in the black darkness it was seldom needed certainly he had never faded he was thin and tough still but the thing was eating up his mind of course and the torment had become almost unbearable all the great Secrets under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night there was nothing more to find out nothing worth doing only nasty

          
          02:49:57
          furtive eating and resentful remembering he was altogether wretched he hated the dark and he hated light more he hated everything and the ring most of all what do you mean said Frodo surely the ring was his precious and the only thing he cared for but if he hated it why didn't he get rid of it or go away and leave it you ought to begin to understand Frodo after all you have heard said Gandalf he hated it and loved it as he hated and loved himself he couldn't get rid of it he had no will left in the

          
          02:50:36
          matter a ring of power looks after itself rodo it may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons it at most he plays with the idea of handing it on to some someone else's care and that only at an early stage when it first begins to grip but as far as I know billbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing and really done it he needed all my help too and even so he would never have just forsaken it or cast it aside it was not Gollum froo but the ring itself that decided things the ring left him what

          
          02:51:19
          just in time to meet Bilbo said Frodo wouldn't an orc have suited it better it is no laughing matter said Gandalf not for you it was the strangest event in the whole history of the ring so far Bilbo's arrival just at that time and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark there was more than one power at work Frodo the ring was trying to get back to its Master it had slipped from iser's hand and bet betrayed him then when a chance came it caught po deagle and he was murdered and after that gollem and it

          
          02:51:56
          had devoured him it could make no further use of him he was too small and mean and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again so now when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from merkwood it abandoned Gollum only to be picked up by the the most unlikely person imaginable Bilbo from the sh behind that there was something else at work Beyond any design of the Ring Maker I can put it no pler than by saying that Bilbo was meant to find the ring and not by its maker in which case

          
          02:52:39
          you also Were Meant to have it and that may be an encouraging thought it is not said Frodo though I'm not sure that I understand you but how have you learned all this about the ring and about Gollum do you really know it all or are you just guessing still Gandalf looked at Frodo and his eyes glinted I knew much and I have learned much he answered but I'm not going to give an account of all my doings to you the history of alil and isor and the one ring is known to all the wise your ring is shown to be that

          
          02:53:17
          one ring by the fire writing alone apart from any other evidence and when did you discover that asked Frodo interrupting just now in this room of course answered the wizard sharply but I expected to find it I have come back from dark Journeys a long search to make that final test it is the last proof and all is now only too clear making out gollum's part and fitting it into the Gap in the history required some thought I may have started with guesses about Gollum but I am not guessing now I know

          
          02:53:55
          I have seen him you have seen Gollum exclaimed Frodo in amazement yes the obvious thing to do of course if one could I tried long ago but I have managed it at last then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him do you know that not so clearly what I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell though not of of course in the way I have reported it Gollum is a liar and you have to sift his words for instance he called the ring his birthday present and he stuck to that he said it came from his grandmother who had lots of

          
          02:54:31
          beautiful things of that kind a ridiculous story I have no doubt that smiggle's grandmother was a matriarch a great person in her way but to talk of her possessing many Elven Rings was absurd and as for giving them away it was a lie but a lie with the grain of Truth the murder of deagle haunted Gollum and he made up a defense repeating it to his precious over and over again as he gwed bones in the dark until he almost believed it it was his birthday deagle ought to have given the ring to him it had obviously turned up

          
          02:55:09
          just so as to be a present it was his birthday present and so on and on I endured him as long as I could but the the truth was desperately important and in the end I had to be harsh I put the fear of fire on him and rung the true story out of him bit by bit together with much sniveling and snarling he thought he was misunderstood and Ill used but when he had at last told me his history as far as the end of the riddle game and Bilbo's Escape he would not say anymore except in dark hints some other

          
          02:55:45
          fear was on him greater than mine he muttered that he was going to get his own back people would see if he would stand being kicked and driven into a hole and then robbed Gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong they would help him Baggins would pay for it that was his chief thought he hated Bilbo and cursed his name what is more he knew where he came from and how did he find that out asked Frodo well as for the name Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself and after that it would

          
          02:56:19
          not be difficult to discover his country once Gollum came out oh yes he came out his longing for the ring proved stronger than his fear of the Orcs or even of the light after a year or two he left the mountains you see though still Bound by desire of it the ring was no longer devouring him he began to revive a little he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry light light of sun and moon he still feared and hated and he always will I think but he was cunning he found he could hide

          
          02:56:57
          from daylight and moonshine and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightened or unwary things he grew stronger and Bolder with new food and new air he found his way into merkwood as one would expect is that where you found him asked Frodo I saw him there answered gandal but before that he had wandered far following Bilbo's Trail it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats what had it got in

          
          02:57:32
          its pockets is he said it wouldn't say no precious little cheat not a fair question it cheated first it did it broke the rules we ought to have squeezed it Yes precious and we will precious that is a sample of his talk I don't suppose you want anymore I had weary days of it but from hence dropped among the snars I gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to asgaroth and even to the streets of Dale listening secretly and peering well the news of the great events went far and wide in wilderland and many had heard

          
          02:58:13
          Bilbo's name and near where he came from we made no secret of our return journey to his home in the west gollum's sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted then why didn't he track Bilbo further asked Frodo why didn't he come to the Sha ah said Gandalf now we come to it I think Gollum tried to he set out and came back Westward as far as the Great River but then he turned aside he was not daunted by the distance I'm sure no something else Drew him away so my friends think those that hunted him for

          
          02:58:52
          me the wood elves tracked him first an easy task for them for his Trail was fresh then through merkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him the wood was full of the rumor of him Dreadful Tales even among beasts and birds the Woodmen said that there was some new Terror abroad a ghost that drank blood it climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes to find the Young it slipped through Windows to find cradles but at the western edge of merkwood the trail turned away it wandered off southwards and passed out

          
          02:59:29
          of the wood El's Ken and was lost and then I made a great mistake yes Frodo and not the first though I fear it may prove the worst I let the matter be I let him go for I had much else to think of at the time and I still trusted the the Lord of Salamon well that was years ago I've paid for it since with many Dark and Dangerous days the trail was long cold when I took it up again after Bilbo left here and my search would have been in vain but for the help that I had from a friend Aragorn the greatest traveler and

          
          03:00:09
          Huntsman of this age of the world together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of wilderland without hope and without success but at last when I had given up the Chase and turned to other parts Gollum was found my friend returned out of great perils bringing the miserable creature with him what he had been doing he would not say he only wept and called us cruel with many a Gollum in his throat and when we pressed him he whined and cringed and rubbed his long hands licking his fingers as if

          
          03:00:42
          they pained him as if he remembered some old torture but I am afraid there is no possible doubt he had made his slow sneaking way step by step mile by mile south down at last to the land of Mordor a heavy silence fell in the room Frodo could hear his heart beating even outside everything seemed still no sound of Sam shears could now be heard yes to Mordor said Gandalf alas Mordor draws all wicked things and the dark power was bending all its will to gather them there the Ring of the enemy would leave

          
          03:01:24
          its Mark too leave him open to the summons and all folk were Whispering then of the new shadow in the South and its hatred of the West there were his fine new friends who would help him in his revenge wretched fool in that land he would learn much too much for his comfort and sooner or later as he lurked and pride on the borders he would be caught and taken for examination that was the way of it I fear when he was found he had already been there long and was on his way back on some errand of Mischief but that

          
          03:02:00
          doesn't matter much now his worst Mischief was done yes alas through him the enemy has learned that the one has been found again he knows where isor fell he knows where Gollum found his ring he knows that it is a great ring for it gave long life he knows that it is not one of the three for they have never been lost and they endure no evil he knows that it is not one of the seven or the nine for they are accounted for he knows that it is the one and he has at last heard I think of Hobbits and the Sha the Sha he

          
          03:02:43
          may be seeking for it now if he has not already found out where it lies indeed from Roo I fear that he may even think that the long unnoticed name of bgins has become important but this is terrible cried Frodo far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings oh Gandalf best of friends what am I to do for now I'm really afraid what am I to do what a Pity that Bilbo didn't stab that vile creature when he had a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand pity and mercy not to strike with need

          
          03:03:19
          and he has been well rewarded Frodo be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil and escaped in the end because he began his ownership of the ring so with pity I'm sorry said Frodo but I'm frightened and I don't feel any pity for Gollum you haven't seen him Gandalf broke in no and I don't want to said Frodo I can't understand you do you mean to say that you and the elves have let him live on after all these horrible s now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc and just an enemy he deserves death

          
          03:03:55
          deserves it I dare say he does many that live deserve death and some that die deserve life can you give it to them then do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment for even the very wise cannot see all ends I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies but there is a chance of it and his bow bured up with the fate of the Ring my heart tells me that he has some part to play yet for good or ill before the end and when that comes the pity of Bilbo May rule the fate of many yours not least in any case

          
          03:04:33
          we didn't kill him he is very old and very wretched the wood elves have him in prison but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise Hearts all the same said Frodo even if Bilbo couldn't kill gollem I wish he hadn't kept the ring I wish he had never found it and that I had not got it why did you let me keep it why didn't you make me throw it away or or destroy it let you make you said the wizard haven't you been listening to all that I have said you are not thinking of what you are saying but as for throwing

          
          03:05:09
          it away that was obviously wrong these rings have a way of being found in evil hands it might have done great evil worst of all it might have fallen into the hands of the enemy indeed it certainly would for this is the one and he is exerting all his power to find it or Draw it to himself of course my dear Frodo it was dangerous for you and that has troubled me deeply but there was so much at stake that I had to take some risk though even when I was Far Away there has never been a day when the sh

          
          03:05:44
          has not been guarded by watchful eyes as long as you never used it I did not think that the ring would have any lasting effect on you not for evil not at any rate for a very long time and you must remember that 9 years ago when I last saw you I still knew little for certain but why not destroy it as you say should have been done long ago cried Frodo again if you had warned me or even sent me a message I would have done away with it would you how would you do that have you ever tried no but I suppose one

          
          03:06:19
          could hammer it or melt it try said Gandalf try now froo drew the ring out of his pocket again and looked at it it now appeared plain and smooth without Mark or device that he could see the gold looked very fair and pure and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its color how perfect was its roundness it was an admirable thing and altogether precious when he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the the very hottest part of the fire but he found now that he could not do so not without a great

          
          03:06:53
          struggle he weighed the ring in his hand hesitating and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him and then with an effort of will he made a movement as if to cast it away but he found that he had put it back in his pocket Gandalf laughed grimly you see already you too Frodo cannot easily Let It Go no will to damage it and I could not make you except by force which would break your mind but as for breaking the ring force is useless even if you took it and struck it with a heavy Sledgehammer it would make no dent in it

          
          03:07:31
          it cannot be unmade by your hands or by mine your small fire of course would not melt even ordinary gold this ring has already passed through it unscathed and even unheated but there is no Smith's Forge in this shine that could change it at all not even the anvils and furnaces of the dwarves could do that it has been said the Dragonfire could melt and consume the rings of power but there is not now any dragon left on Earth in which the old fire is hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not even UNC colon

          
          03:08:09
          the black who could have harmed the One Ring the ruling ring for that was made by saurin himself there is only one way to find the cracks of Doom in the depths of orodruin the Fire Mountain and cast the ring in there if you really wish to destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy forever I do really wish to destroy it cried Frodo oh well to have it destroyed I'm not made for perilous quests I wish I'd never seen the ring why did it come to me why was I chosen such questions cannot be answered said

          
          03:08:45
          Gandalf you may be sure that it was not for any Merit that others do not possess not for power or wisdom at any rate but you have been chosen and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have but I have so little of any of these things you are wise and Powerful will you not take the ring no cried Gandalf springing to his feet with that power I should have power too great and terrible and over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly his eyes flashed and his

          
          03:09:18
          face was lit as by a Fire Within do not tempt me for I do not wish to become like the dark lord himself yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good do not tempt me I dare not take it not even to keep it safe unused the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength I shall have such need of it great perils lie before me he went to the window window and Drew aside the curtains and the shutters sunlight streamed back again into the room Sam

          
          03:09:54
          passed along the path outside whistling and now said the wizard turning back to Frodo the decision lies with you but I will always help you he laid his hand on Frodo's shoulder I will help you bear this burden as long as it is yours to Bear but we must do something soon the enemy is moving there was a long silence Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought his eyes seemed closed but under the lids he was watching Frodo intently Frodo gazed fixedly at the red Embers on the Hearth until they filled

          
          03:10:35
          all his vision and he seemed to be looking down into profound Wells of fire he was thinking of the fabled cracks of Doom and the terror of the fiery Mountain well said Gandalf at last what do you think about have you decided what to do no answered Frodo coming back to himself out of darkness and finding to his surprise that it was not dark and that out of the window he could see the sunlet Garden or perhaps yes as far as I understand what you have said I suppose I must keep the ring and guard it at

          
          03:11:08
          least for the present whatever it may do to me whatever it may do it will be slow slow to evil if you keep it with that purpose said Gandalf I hope so said Frodo but I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon but in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger a danger to all that live near me I cannot keep the ring and stay here I ought to leave bagend leave the sh leave everything and go away he sighed I should like to save the sh if I could though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and

          
          03:11:44
          dull for words and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them but I don't feel like that now I feel that as long as the sh lies behind safe and comfortable I shall find Wandering more bearable I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold even if my feet cannot stand there again of course I have sometimes thought of going away but I imagined that as a kind of holiday a series of Adventures like bilbow or better ending in peace but this would mean Exile a flight from

          
          03:12:21
          danger into danger drawing it after me and I suppose I must go alone if I to do that and save the Sha but I feel very small and very uprooted and well desperate the enemy is so strong and terrible he did not tell Gandalf but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart to follow Bilbo and even perhaps to find him again again it was so strong that it overcame his fear he could almost have run out there and then down the road without his hat as Bilbo had done on a similar

          
          03:12:58
          morning long ago my dear Frodo exclaimed Gandalf hbits really are amazing creatures as I've said before you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month and yet after a 100 years they can still surprise you at a pinch I hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you but Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his Heir though he little thought how important it would prove I'm afraid you are right the ring will not be able to stay hidden in the sh much longer and for your own sake as

          
          03:13:34
          well as for others you will have to go and leave the name of Baggins behind you that name will not be safe to have outside the Sha or in the wild I will give you a traveling name now when you go go as Mr Underhill but I don't think you need go alone not if you know of anyone you can trust and who would be willing to go by your side and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils but if you look for a companion be careful in choosing and be careful of what you say even to your closest friends the enemy

          
          03:14:11
          has many spies and many ways of hearing suddenly he stopped as if listening fra became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside Gandalf crept to one side of the window then with a dart he sprang to the seal and thrust a long arm out and downwards there was a squark and up came Sam GJ's curly head hauled by one ear well well bless my beard said Gandalf Sam gamji is it now what may you be doing Lord bless you Mr Gandalf sir said Sam nothing least ways I was just trimming the grass border under the

          
          03:14:48
          window if you follow me he picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence I don't said Gandalf grimly it is some time since I last heard the sound of your shears how long have you been eavesdropping Eaves dropping sir I don't follow you're begging your pardon there ain't no Eaves at Bag End and that's a fact don't be a fool what have you heard and why did you listen Gandalf's eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles Mr Frodo sir cried Sam quaking don't let him hurt me sir don't let him

          
          03:15:21
          turn me into anything unnatural my old dad would take on so I meant no harm On My Honor sir he won't hurt you said Frodo hardly able to keep from laughing although he was himself startled and rather puzzled he knows as well as I do that you mean no harm but just you up and answer his question straight away well sir said Sam dithering a little I heard a deal that I didn't rightly understand about an enemy and rings and Mr Bilbo sir and dragons and a fiery mountain and and elves sir I listened because I couldn't help myself if you

          
          03:15:58
          know what I mean Lord bless me sir but I do love Tales of that sort and I believe them too whatever Ted may say elves sir I would dearly love to see them couldn't you take me to see elves sir when you go suddenly gandaf laughed come inside he shouted and putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam shears grass clippings and all right through the window and stood him on the floor take you to see elves he said eyeing Sam closely but with a smile flickering on his face so you heard that Mr Frodo is

          
          03:16:34
          going away I did Sir and that's why I choked which you heard seemingly I tried not to sir but it burst out of me I was so upset it can't be helped Sam said fr sadly he had suddenly realized that flying from the sh would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the familiar Comforts of Bag End I shall have to go but and here he looked hard at Sam if you really care about me you will keep that Dead secret see if you don't if you even breathe a word of what you've heard here then I

          
          03:17:10
          hope gandal will turn you into a spotted Toad and fill the garden full of grass snakes Sam fell on his knees trembling get up Sam said Gandalf I've thought of something better than that something to shut your mouth and punish you properly for listening you shall go away with Mr Frodo me sir cried Sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk me go and see elves and all hooray he shouted and then burst into tears chapter three three is company you ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon said Gandalf two or

          
          03:17:57
          three weeks had passed and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to go I know but it's difficult to do both he objected if I just vanish like Bilbo the tail will be all over the sh in no time of course you mustn't vanish said Gandalf that wouldn't do it all I said soon not instantly if you can think of any way of slipping out of the sh without its being generally known it will be worth a little today but you must not delay too long what about the Autumn or after our birthday asked Frodo I think I could

          
          03:18:31
          probably make some arrangements by then to tell the truth he was very reluctant to start now that it had come to the point bagend seemed a more desirable residence than it had for years and he wanted to saber as much as he could of his life last summer in the Sha when autumn came he knew that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of journeying as it always did at that season he had indeed privately made up his mind to leave on his 50th birthday Bilbo's 128th it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and

          
          03:19:07
          follow him following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearable he thought as little as possible about about the ring and where it might lead him in the end but he did not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf what the wizard guest was always difficult to tell he looked at Frodo and smiled very well he said I think that will do but it must not be any later I'm getting very anxious in the meantime do take care and don't let out any hint of where you're going and see that Sam

          
          03:19:44
          gamji doesn't talk if he does I really shall turn him into a toad as of where I'm going said Frodo it would be difficult to give that away for I have no clear idea myself yet don't be absurd said Gandalf I'm not warning you against leaving an address at the post office but you are leaving the Sha and that should not be known until you're far away and you must go or at least set out either north south west or east and the direction should certainly not be known I've been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End and of

          
          03:20:24
          saying farewell that I've never even considered the direction said Frodo for where am I to go and by what shall I steer what's to be my quest bilbur went to find a treasure there and back again but I go to lose one and not return as far as I can see but you can't see very far said Gandalf neither can I it may be a your task to find the cracks of Doom but that Quest may be for others I don't know at any rate you're not ready for that long road yet no indeed said Frodo but in the meantime what course am I to

          
          03:21:02
          take towards danger but not too rashly not too straight answered the wizard if you want my advice make for rivendale that Journey should not prove too perilous though the road is less easy than it was and it will grow worse as the year fails rivendel said froda very good I will go east and I will make for rivendel I'll take Sam to visit the elves he'll be delighted he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of elron half Elin and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the fair folk

          
          03:21:39
          still dwelt in peace one Summer's evening an astonishing piece of news reached the ivy Bush and Green Dragon Giants and other portents on the borders of the Sha were forgotten for more important matters Mr froo was selling bagend indeed he'd already sold it to the Sackville bagginses for a nice bit too said some at a bargain priced said others and that's more likely when mistress leel is the buyer otho had died some years before at the ripe but disappointed age of 102 just why Mr Frodo was selling his

          
          03:22:19
          beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price a few held the theory supported by the nods and hints of Mr Baggins himself that Frodo's money was running out he was going to leave hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his brandybuck relations as far from the Saville Bings as as maybe some added but so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the B of bag and become that most found this hard to believe harder than any other reason or unreason that

          
          03:22:53
          their fancy could suggest to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day it was well known that he was hiding up in the bag end but however a removal might fit in with the designs of his Wizardry there was no doubt about the fact Frodo baggin was going back to Buckland yes I shall be moving this Autumn he said Mary brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me or perhaps a small house as a matter of fact with Mary's

          
          03:23:30
          help he had already Chosen and bought a little house at Crick Hollow in the country Beyond bucklebury to all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently the decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him for Buckland was on the Eastern borders of the Sha and as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at least seemed credible gandal stayed in the Sha for over 2 months then one evening at the end of June soon after Frodo's plan had been finally arranged he suddenly

          
          03:24:05
          announced that he was going off again next morning only for a short while I hope he said but I'm going down beyond the southern borders to get some news if I can I been idle longer than I should he spoke lightly but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried has anything happened he asked well no but I've heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into if I think it necessary after all for you to get off at once I shall come back immediately or at least send word in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more

          
          03:24:41
          careful than ever especially the ring let me impress on you once more don't use it he went off at Dawn I may be back any day he said at the very latest I shall come back for the farewell party I think after all you may need my company on the road at first Frodo was a good deal Disturbed and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard but his uneasiness wore off and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while the Sha had seldom seen so fair a summer or so rich in Autumn the trees were Laden with apples honey was

          
          03:25:20
          Dripping in the Combs and the corn was tall and full Autumn was well underway before Frodo began to worry about gandal again September was passing and there was still no news of him the birthday and the removal Drew nearer and still he didn't come or send word bag ended began to be busy some of Frodo's friends came to stay and help him with a packing there was Fred Baler and Falco bofin and of course his special friends Pippin Tuk and Mary brandybuck between them they turned the whole place upside

          
          03:25:56
          down on September the 20th two covered carts went off Laden to Buckland conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home by way of the Brandywine Bridge the next day Frodo became really anxious and kept a constant lookout for Gandalf Thursday his birthday morning dawned as Fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbo's great party still Gandalf did not appear in the evening Frodo gave his Farewell Feast it was quite small just a dinner for himself and His Four helpers but he

          
          03:26:29
          was troubled and felt in no mood for it the thought that he would so soon have to part with his young friends weade on his heart he wondered how he would break it to them the four younger Hobbits were however in High Spirits and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf's absence the dining room was Bare except for a table and chairs but the food was good and there was good wine Frodo's wine had not been included in the sale to the saille biners whatever happens the rest of my stuff when the SBS get their claws on it

          
          03:27:05
          at any rate I found a good home for this said Frodo as he drained his glass it was the last drop of old wyards when they hadd sung many songs and talked of many things that done together they toasted Bilbo's birthday and they drank his health and Frodo together according to Frodo's custom then they went out for a sniff of air and glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed Frodo's party was over and Gandalf had not come the next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage Mary took charge of this

          
          03:27:44
          and drove off with fatty that is Fred bger someone must get there and warm the house before you arrive said Mary well see you later the day after tomorrow if you don't go to sleep on the way Falco went home after lunch but Pippen remained behind froda was restless and anxious listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf he decided to wait until Nightfall after that if Gandalf wanted him urgently he would go to cric hollow and might even get there first for Frodo was going on foot his plan for pleasure

          
          03:28:18
          and a last look at the sh as much as for any other reason was to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury Ferry taking it fairly easy I shall get myself a bit into training too he said looking at himself in a Dusty mirror in the half empty Hall he hadn't done any strenuous walking for a long time and the reflection looked rather flabby he thought after lunch the Sackville biners Lilia and her sandy-haired son Lo turned up much to Frodo's annoyance ours at last said liilia as she stepped inside it was not polite nor strictly true for

          
          03:28:57
          the sale of Bag End did not take effect until midnight but liilia can perhaps be forgiven she had been obliged to wait about 77 years longer for bagend than she once hoped and she was now 100 years old anyway she'd come to see that nothing she paid for had been carried off and she wanted the keys it took a long while to satisfy her as she' brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it in the end she departed with loo and the spare key in the promise that the other key would be left at the games in bagshot row she

          
          03:29:31
          snorted and showed plainly that she thought the gamji capable of plundering the whole during the night Frodo did not offer her any tea he took his own tea with Pippen and Sam gamji in the kitchen it had been officially announced that Sam Sam was coming to Buckland to do for Mr Frodo and look after his bit of garden an arrangement that was approved by the gaffer though it did not console him for the prospect of having liilia as a neighbor our last meal at Bag End said Frodo pushing back his chair they left

          
          03:30:04
          the washing up for Lilia Pippen and Sam strapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch pipen went out for a last stroll in the garden Sam disappeared the son went down Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and disheveled Frodo wandered around the familiar rooms and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep out of the corners it grew slowly dark indoors he went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path and then on a short way down the hill road he half expected to see gandel come

          
          03:30:40
          striding up through the dusk the sky was clear and the stars were growing bright it's going to be a fine night he said aloud that's good for a beginning I feel like walking I can't bear any more hanging about I'm going to start and Gandalf must follow me he turned to go back and then stopped for he heard voices just around the corner by the end of bagshot row One Voice Was certainly the old Gaffers the other was strange and somehow unpleasant he couldn't make out what it said but he heard the gaffer's answers

          
          03:31:17
          which were rather shrill the old man seemed put out no Mr bins has gone away I went this morning and my Sam went with him anyway all his stuff went Yes sold out and gone I tell he why why is none of my business or yours where too that ain't no secret he's moved to bleb or some such place away Down Yonder yes it is a tidy way I've never been so far myself they are queer folks in Buckland no I can't give no message good night to you footsteps went away down the hill Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that

          
          03:31:59
          they did not come on up the hill seemed a great relief I'm sick of questions and curiosity about my doings I suppose he thought what an inquisitive lot they all are he'd half a mind to go and ask the gaffer Who The Inquirer was but he thought Better or Worse of it and turned and walked quickly back to Bag End Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch Sam was not there froo stepped inside the Dark Door Sam he called Sam time coming sir came the answer from Far within followed soon by Sam himself

          
          03:32:35
          wiping his mouth he'd been saying farewell to the Beer Barrel in the cellar All Aboard Sam said Frodo yes sir I last for a bit now sir Frodo shut and locked the round door and gave the key to Sam run down with this to your home Sam he said then cut along the row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane Beyond The Meadows we are not going through the village tonight too many ears pricking and eyes prying Sam ran off at full speed well now we're off at last said Frodo they shouldered their

          
          03:33:10
          packs and took up their sticks and walked around the corner to the west side of Bag End goodbye said Frodo looking at the dark blank Windows he waved his hand and then turned and following Bilbo if he had known it hurried after perigrine down the Garden Path they jumped over the low place in the Hedge at the bottom and took to the fields passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses at the bottom of the hill on its western side they came to the gate opening onto a narrow Lane there they halted and adjusted the

          
          03:33:44
          stps of their packs presently Sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing hard his heavy peack was hoisted high on his shoulders and he had put on his head a tall shapeless felt bag which he called a hat in the Gloom he looked very much like a dwarf I'm sure you've given me all the heaviest stuff said Frodo I pity snails and all that carry their homes on their backs I could take a little more yet sir my packet is quite light said Sam stoutly and untruthfully no you don't Sam said Pippen it's good for him he's got

          
          03:34:23
          nothing except what he ordered us to pack he's been slack lately and he'll feel the white less when he's walked off some of his own be kind to a poor old Hobbit laughed Frodo I shall be as thin as a willow wand I'm sure before I get to Buckland but I was talking nonsense I suspect you've taken more than your fair share Sam and I shall look into do it at our next packing he picked up his stick again well we all like walking in the dark he said so let's put some miles behind us before bed for a short way they followed the

          
          03:34:59
          lane westwards then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields again they went in single file along hedge RS and the borders of cuses and a night fell dark about them in their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they had all had magic rings since they were all Hobbits and were trying to be silent they made no noise that even Hobbits would hear even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing after sometime they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow plank

          
          03:35:34
          Bridge the stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon bordered with leaning aler trees a mile or two further south they hastily crossed the Great Road from the Brandy Wine Bridge they were now in the Tok land and bending southeastwards they made for the Green Hill Country as they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle Valley of the water soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land and was followed by Bywater beside its gray pool when the

          
          03:36:09
          light of the last Farm was Far Behind peeping among the trees Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell I wonder if I shall ever look down into that Valley again he said quietly when they had walked for about 3 hours they rested the night was clear cool and Starry but smoke likee wisps of mist were creeping up the hillsides from the streams and deep Meadows th clad Birches swaying in a light wind above their heads made a black net against the pale sky they ate a very frugal supper for Hobbits and then went on again soon they

          
          03:36:51
          struck a narrow road that went rolling up and down fading gray into the darkness ahead the road to Wood Hall and stock and the Buckle Bri Ferry it climbed away from the main road in the Water Valley and wound over the skirts of the Green Hills towards Woody end a wild corner of the East faring after a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night it was very dark at first they talked or hummed a tun softly together being now far away from inquisitive ears

          
          03:37:28
          then they marched on in silence and Pippen began to lag behind at last as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned I am so sleepy he said that soon I shall fall down on the road are you going to sleep on your legs it's nearly midnight I thought you liked walking in the dark said Frodo but there's no great hurry Mary expects us sometime the day after tomorrow but that leaves us nearly two days more we'll halt at the first likely spot the winds in the west said Sam if we get to the other side of this hill we

          
          03:38:08
          shall find a spot that's sheltered and snug enough sir there's a dry furwood just ahead if I remember rightly Sam knew the land well within 20 mi of hobbiton but that was the limit of his geography just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of furwood leaving the road they went into the deep resin centered darkness of the trees and gathered dead sticks and Cones to make a far soon they had a Mery crackle of flame at the foot of a large fur tree and they sat round it for a while until they began to nod then each at an angle

          
          03:38:44
          at the great trees Roots they curled up in their cloaks and blankets and were soon fast asleep they set no watch even Frodo feared no danger yet for they were still in the heart of the Shar a few creatures came and looked at them when the far had died away a fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed hits he thought well what next I've heard of strange doings in this land but I've seldom heard of a Hobbit sleeping out of under tree three of them there's

          
          03:39:19
          something Mighty queer behind this he was quite right but he never found out anymore about it the morning came pale and clammy Frodo woke up first and found that a tree root had made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff walking for pleasure why didn't I drive he thought as he usually did at the beginning of an expedition and all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the Sackville biners these tree roots would do them good he stretched wake up hits he cried It's a beautiful morning what's beautiful about it said

          
          03:39:58
          Pippen peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye Sam get breakfast ready for half 9 have you got the bath water hot Sam jumped up looking rather blury no sir I haven't sir he said Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippen and rolled him over and then walked off to the edge of the wood away Eastward the sun was Rising red out of The Mists that lay thick on the world touched with gold and red the Autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea a little below him to the left the road ran down

          
          03:40:33
          steeply into a hollow and disappeared when he returned Sam and Pippen had got a good fire going water shouted Pippen where's the water I don't keep water in my pockets said Frodo we thought you hadd gone to find some said Pippen busy setting out the food and cups you'd better go now you can come too said Frodo and bring all the water bottles there was a stream at the foot of the Hill they filled their bottles on the small camping Kettle at A Little Fall where the water fell a few feet over an outcrop of gry stone it was

          
          03:41:08
          icy cold and they spluttered and puffed as they bathed their faces and hands when their breakfast was over and their packs all trussed up again it was after 10:00 and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot they went down the slope and across the stream where it dived under the road and up the next slope and up and down another shoulder of the hills and by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other gear already seemed a heavy burden the day's March promised to be warm and Tiding work after some miles

          
          03:41:43
          however the road ceased to roll up and down it climbed to the top of a steep Bank in a weary zigzagging sort of way and then prepared to go down for the last time in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown Woodland Haze they were looking across the Woody end toward the Brandy Wine River the road wound away before them like a piece of string the road goes on forever said Pippen but I can't without a rest it's high time for lunch he sat down on the

          
          03:42:18
          bank at the side of the road and looked away East into the haze Beyond which lay the river and the end of the sh in which he had spent all his life Sam stood by him his round eyes were wide open for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a New Horizon do elves live in those woods he asked not that I've ever heard said Pippen Frodo was silent he too was gazing Eastward along the road as if he'd never seen it before suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself saying slowly the road goes ever on and on down

          
          03:42:58
          from the door where it began now far ahead the road is gone and I must follow if I can pursuing it with weary feet until it joins some larger way where many paths and erands meet and with then I cannot say that sounds like a bit of old Bilbo's rhyming said Pippin or is it one of your imitations it doesn't sound altogether encouraging I don't know said Frodo it came to me then as if I was making it up but I may have heard it long ago certainly it reminds me very much of Bilbo in the last years before he went

          
          03:43:36
          away he used often to say that there was only one road that it was like a great River its Springs were at every doorstep and every path was a it's tribut it's a dangerous business Frodo going out of your door he used to say you step into the road and if you don't keep your feet there's no knowing where you might be swept off to do you realize that this is the very last path that goes through merkwood and that if you let it it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to worse places he used to say that on the path

          
          03:44:09
          outside the front door at B end especially after it'd been out for a long walk well the road won't sweep me anywhere for an hour at least said Pippen unsl slinging his pack the others followed his example putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the road after a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest the sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill so far they'd not met a soul on the road this way was not much used being hardly fit

          
          03:44:45
          for carts and there was little traffic to the Woody end they'd been jogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening they were now on level ground and the road after much winding lay Straight Ahead through grassland sprinkled with tall trees outliers of the approaching Woods I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind said Sam they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us said Frodo but even as he said it he

          
          03:45:21
          had a feeling that it was not so and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him it may not matter much he said apologetically but I would rather not be seen on the road by anyone I'm sick of my doings being noticed and discussed and if it is Gandalf he added as an afterthought we can give him a little surprise to pay him out for being so late let's get out of sight the other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little Hollow not far from the road there they lay flat

          
          03:45:56
          Frodo hesitated for a second curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide the sound of hoes Drew nearer just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots Round the Corner came a black horse no Hobbit Pony but a full-sized horse and on it sat a large man who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a great black cloak and Hood so that only his boots in the high stips showed below his

          
          03:46:31
          face was shadowed and invisible when it reached the tree and was level with thodo the horse stopped the riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listening from inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent the head turned from side to side of the road a sudden unreasoning fear of Discovery laid hold of Frodo and he thought of his ring he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand he felt

          
          03:47:05
          that he had only to slip it on and then he would be safe the advice of Gandalf seemed absurd Bilbo had used the ring and I am still in the sh he thought as his hand touched the chain on which it hung at that moment the rider sat up and shook the rains the horse stepped forward walking slowly at first and then breaking into a quick Trot Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider until he dwindled into the distance he could not be quite sure but it seemed to him that suddenly before it passed out of sight

          
          03:47:41
          the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right well well I call that very queer and indeed disturbing said Frodo to himself as he walked towards his companions Pippen and Sam had remained flat in the grass and had seen nothing so Frodo described the riter and his strange Behavior I can't say why but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me and also I felt certain that I didn't want him to discover me I've never seen or felt anything like it in the sh before but what what is one of the big

          
          03:48:16
          people got to do with us said Pippin and what is he doing in this part of the world there are some men about said Frodo down in the South faring they have had trouble with big people I believe but I have never heard of anything like this Rider I wonder where he comes from begging your pardon put in Sam suddenly I know where he comes from it's from hobbiton that this ear Black Rider comes unless there's more than one and I know where he's going to what do you mean said fro sharply looking at him in

          
          03:48:51
          astonishment why didn't you speak up before I've only just remembered sir it was like this when I got back to our hole yesterday evening with a key my dad he says to me hello Sam he says I thought you were away with Mr Frodo this morning there's been a strange customer asking for Mr bagin a Bag End and he's only just gone I've sent him on to bucklebury not that I liked the sound of him he seemed Mighty put out when I told him Mr Baggins had left his old home for good H at me he did it gave me quite a

          
          03:49:25
          shudder what sort of fellow was he says I to the gaffer I don't know says he but he wasn't a hobbit he was tall and black like and he stooped over me I reckon it was one of the big folk from foreign Parts he spoke funny I couldn't stay here more sir since you were eating and I didn't give much heed to it myself the gaffer is getting old and more than a bit blind and it must have been near dark when this fellow came up the hill and found him taking the air at the end of our row I hope he hasn't done no harm sir nor

          
          03:50:03
          me the gaffer can't be blamed Anyway said Fredo as a matter of fact I heard him talking to a stranger who seemed to be inquiring for me and I nearly went and asked him who it was I wish I had or you'd told me about it before I might have been more careful on the road still there may be no connection between this Rider and the gaffer stranger said Pippen we left hobbiton secretly enough and I don't see how he could have followed this what about the smelling sir said Sam and the gaffer said he was a black

          
          03:50:39
          chap I wish I had waited for Gandalf Frodo muttered but perhaps it would have only made matters worse then you know or guess something about this Rider said Pippen who had caught the muttered words I don't know and I'd rather not guess said Frodo all right cousin Frodo you can keep your secret for the present if you want to be mysterious in the meanwhile what are we to do I should like a bite and a subp but somehow I think we'd better move on from here your talk of sniffing riders with invisible

          
          03:51:14
          noses has unsettled me yes I think we'll move on now said Frodo but not on the road in case that Rider comes back or another follows him we ought to do a good step more today Buckland is still miles away the Shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass as they started off again they now kept a stone throw to the left of the road and kept out of sight of it as much as they could but this hindered the for the grass was thick and tusky and the ground uneven and the trees began to draw together

          
          03:51:50
          into thickets the sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs and evening was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of The Long Level over which it had run straight for some miles at that point it bent left and went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for stock but Elaine branched right winding through a wood of ancient oak trees on its way to Wood Hall that is the way for us said Frodo not far from the road meeting they came on the huge Hulk of a tree it was still alive and had leaves on the small

          
          03:52:26
          branches that it had put out around the broken stumps of its long Fallen limbs but it was Hollow and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed wood they rested and had a light meal talking quietly and listening from time to time Twilight was about them as they crept back to the Lane the west wind was sighing in the branches leaves were Whispering soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk a star

          
          03:53:02
          came out above the trees and the darkening East before them they went AB breast and in step to keep up their Spirits after time as the Stars grew thicker and brighter the feeling of disquiet left them and they no longer listened for the sound of hooves they began to hum Softly As Hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along especially when they are drawing near to home at night with most Hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song but these Hobbits hummed a walking song though not of course without any mention of supper

          
          03:53:36
          and bed billbo Baggins had made the words to a tune that was as old as the hills and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lane of the Water Valley and talked about Adventure upon the Hearth the fire is red beneath the roof there is a bed but not yet where they are our feet still around the corner we may meet our sden tree or a standing stone that none have seen but we alone tree and flow and leaf and grass let them pass let them pass he and water and the sky pass them by pass them by still round the corner there may wait a

          
          03:54:23
          new road or a secret gate and though we pass them by today tomorrow we may come this way and take the hidden paths that run towards the moon or to the sun Apple Thorn and KN and slow let them go let them go sand and Stone and pool and Dell fair you well fair you well home is behind the world ahead and there are many parts to tread through Shadows to the edge of night until the stars are all a light then World Behind and home ahead we wander back to home and bed mist and Twilight cloud and shade

          
          03:55:14
          away shall Fade Away shall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and then to bed and then to [Music] bad the song ended and now to bed and now to bed sang Pippen in a high voice hush said fro I think I hear Hooves again they stopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree Shadows listening there was a sound of hooves in the lane some way behind but coming slow and clear down the wind quickly and quietly they sipped off the path and ran into the Deeper Shade under the oak trees don't let us go too far said Frodo I don't

          
          03:55:55
          want to be seen But I want to see if it's another Black Rider very well said Pippen but don't forget the sniffing the Hooves Drew nearer they had no time to find any hiding place better than the general Darkness under the trees Sam and Pippen crouched behind the large tree Bowl while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane it showed gray and pale a line of fading light through the wood above it the stars were thick in the dim sky but there was no moon the sound of hoof stopped as Frodo watched he saw

          
          03:56:31
          something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees and then halt it looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller Black Shadow the black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path and it swayed from side to side Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling the Shadow bent to the ground and then began to craw towards him once more the desire to slip on the ring came over Frodo but this time it was stronger than before so strong that almost before he realized

          
          03:57:03
          what he was doing his hand was groping in his pocket but at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter clear voices Rose and fell in the Starlet air the black Shadow straightened up and retreated it climbed onto the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side Frodo breathed again elves exclaimed Sam in a horse whisper elves sir he would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pulled him back yes it is elves said

          
          03:57:40
          Frodo one can meet them sometimes in the Woody end they don't live in the sh but they wander into it in Spring and Autumn out of their own lands away beyond the tower Hills I am thankful that they do you did not see but that Black Rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began as soon as he heard the voices He Slipped Away what about the elves said Sam too excited to trouble about the rer can't we go and see them listen they are coming this way said Frodo we have have

          
          03:58:14
          only to wait the singing Drew nearer one clear voice Rose now above the others it was singing in the fair elen tongue of which Frodo knew only a little and the others knew nothing yet the sound blending with a Melody seemed to shape itself in their thoughts into words which they only partly understood this was the song as froto Heard It Snow White Snow White oh lady clear oh Queen beyond the Western seas oh light to us that wondered here amid the world of woven trees Gil onel o El Beth clear are thy eyes and bright thy

          
          03:59:07
          breath Snow White Snow White We Sing To Thee in a f land beyond the sea oh stars that in the sunless year with shining Hand by her was s in windy Fields now bright and clear we see your Silver Blossom blown El Gil we still remember we who dwell in this far land beneath the trees by Starlight on the west Seas the song ended these are High Elves they spoke the name of elberth said Frodo in amazement few of that fairest folk are ever seen in the Sha not many now remain in Middle Earth east of the great sea

          
          04:00:18
          this is indeed a strange Chance The Hobbit sat in Shadow by the wayside before long the elves came down the lane toward the valley they passed slowly and the hobbits could see the Starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes they bore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer like the light of the Moon Above the Rim of the hills before it rises seemed to fall about their feet they were now silent and as the last elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed Heil Frodo he cried you're

          
          04:00:54
          abroad late or are you perhaps lost then he called aloud to the others and all the company stopped and gathered round this is indeed wonderful they said three Hobbits in a wood at night we have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away what is the meaning of it the mean meaning of it fair people said Frodo is simply that we seem to be going the same way as you are I like walking under the stars but I would welcome your company but we have no need of other company and Hobbits are so dull they laughed and how do you know that we go

          
          04:01:32
          the same way as you for you do not know whether we are going and how do you know my name asked Frodo in return we know many things they said we have seen you often before with Bilbo though you may not have seen us who are you and who is your lord asked Frodo I am gildor answered the leader the elf who had first hailed him gildor and glorian of the House of finrod we are Exiles and most of our Kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only taring here a while a we return over the great sea but some of our kins folk dwell

          
          04:02:11
          still in peace in rivendel come now Roo tell us what you are doing for we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you oh wise people interrupted Pippen eagerly tell us about the Black Riders Black Riders they said in low voices why do you ask about Black Riders because two Black Riders have overtaken us today or one has done so twice said Pippen only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew near the elves did not answer at once but spoke together softly in their own tongue at length gildor turned to the

          
          04:02:49
          hobbits we will not speak of this here he said we think you had best come now with us it is not our custom but for this time we will take you on our road and you shall Lodge with us tonight if you will oh Fair folk this is good fortune Beyond My Hope said Pippen Sam was speechless I thank you indeed gildor and glorian said Frodo bowing El a star Shines on the hour of our meeting he added in the high Elven speech be careful friends cried gildor laughing speak no secrets here is a scholar in the ancient tongue Bilbo was

          
          04:03:33
          a good Master hail El friend he said bowing to Frodo come now with your friends and join our company you had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray you may be weary before we halt why where are you going asked Frodo for tonight we go to the woods on the Hills above wood Hall it is some miles but you shall have rest at the end of it and it will shorten your journey tomorrow they now marched on again in silence and passed like shadows and faint lights for elves even more than Hobbits could walk when they wished

          
          04:04:10
          without sound or footfall Pippin soon began to feel feel sleepy and staggered once or twice but each time a tall elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall Sam walked along at Frodo's side as if in a dream with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished Joy the woods on either side became denser the trees were now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower running down into a fold of the hills there were many deep breaks of Hazel on the rising slopes at I her hand at last

          
          04:04:46
          the elves turned aside from the path a green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right and this they followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes onto the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the river valley suddenly they came out of the Shadows of the trees and before them lay a wide space of grass gray under the night on three sides the woods pressed upon it but Eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees growing at the

          
          04:05:18
          bottom of the slope were below their feet beyond the low lands lay dim and flat Under the Stars nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of Woodhall the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits Frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets and drowsiness stol of over them the night grew on and the lights in the valley went out Pippen fell asleep pillowed on a green hilic away high in the East swung REM

          
          04:05:56
          merath the netted stars and slowly above the mist's red borill rose glowing like a jewel of fire then by some shift of airs all the Mist was drawn away like a veil and there leaned up as he climbed over the rim of the world the swords of the sky menel vagor with his shining belt the elves all burst into song suddenly under the trees a far sprang up with a red light come the elves called to the hobbits come now is the time for speech and medent Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes he shivered there is a fire in the hall

          
          04:06:36
          and food for hungry guests said an elf standing before him at the South End of the green sword there was an opening there the green floor ran on into the wood and formed a wide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees their great trunks ran like pillars down each side in the middle there was a Woodfire blazing and upon the tree pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily the elves sat round the th upon the grass or upon the sorn rings of old trunks some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink

          
          04:07:14
          others brought food on heaped plates and dishes this is poor affair they said to the hobbits for we are lodging in the Greenwood far from our Halls if ever you are our guests at home we will treat you better it seems to me good enough for a birthday party said Frodo Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for his mind was filled with a light upon the elf faces and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream but he remembered that there was bread surpassing the Savor of a fair

          
          04:07:51
          white loaf to one who is starving and fruits sweet as wild berries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draft cool as a clear Fountain golden as a Summer Afternoon Sam could never describe in words nor picture clearly to himself what he felt or thought that night though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life the nearest he ever got was to say well sir if I could grow apples like that I would call myself a Garder but it was the

          
          04:08:28
          singing that went to my heart if you know what I mean Frodo sat eating drinking and talking with delight but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken he knew a little of the elf's speech and listened eagerly now and again his spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language they smiled at him and said laughing here is a jewel among Hobbits after a while Pippen fell fast asleep and was lifted up and borne away to a bar under the trees there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest

          
          04:09:03
          of the night away Sam refused to leave his master when Pippin had gone he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet where at last he nodded and closed his eyes Frodo remained long awake talking with gildor they spoke of many things old and new and Frodo questioned gildor about happenings in the wide world outside the sh the tidings were mostly sad and ominous of gathering Darkness the wars of men and the Flight of the elves at last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart tell me gildor have you ever seen

          
          04:09:43
          Bilbo since he left us gildor smiled yes he answered twice he said A Farewell to us on this very spot but I saw him once again far from here he would say no more about Bilbo and froder fell silent you do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself froder said gildor but I already know a little and I can read more in your face and in the thought behind find your questions you are leaving the sh and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek or accomplish what you intend or that you will ever return is not that so it is

          
          04:10:27
          said Frodo but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam he looked down at Sam who was snoring gently the secret will not reach the enemy from us said gildor the enemy said Frodo then you know why I'm leaving the Sha I do not know for what reason the enemy is pursuing you answered gildor but I perceive that he is strange indeed though that seems to me and I warn you that Peril is now both before you and behind you and upon either side you mean the Riders I fear that they

          
          04:11:06
          were Servants of the enemy what are the Black Riders has Gandalf told you nothing nothing about such creatures then I think it is not for me to say more lest Terror should keep you from your journey for it seems to me that you have set out only just in time if indeed you are in time you must now make haste and neither stay nor turn back for The Shard is no longer any protection to you I can't imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints and warnings exclaimed Frodo I knew the

          
          04:11:40
          danger Airhead of course but I didn't expect to meet it in our own sha can't a hobbit walk from the water to the river in peace but it is not your own sh said gildor others dwelt here before Hobbits were and others will dwell here again when Hobbits are no more the wide world is all about you you can fence yourselves in but you cannot Forever Fence it out I know and yet it's always seemed so safe and familiar what can I do now my plan was to leave the sh secretly and make my way to Rivendell but now my footsteps are dogged before

          
          04:12:20
          ever I get to Buckland I think you should still follow that plan said gildor I do not think the road will prove too hard for your courage but if you desire clear a council you should ask Gandalf I do not know the reason for your flight and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you these things Gandalf must know I suppose that you will see him before you leave the Sha I hope so but that's another thing that makes me anxious I've been expecting gandal for many days he was to have come to hobbiton at the

          
          04:12:57
          latest two nights ago but he's never appeared now I'm wondering what can have happened should I wait for him gildor was silent for a moment I do not like this news he said at last that gandal should be late to does not Bodwell but it is said do not meddle in the Affairs of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger the choice is yours to go or wait and it is also said answered Frodo go not to the elves for consel for they will say both no and yes is it indeed laughed gildor elves seldom give uard at advice for advice is a

          
          04:13:39
          dangerous gift even from the wise to the wise and all cost may run ill but what would you you have not told me all concerning yourself and how then should I choose better than you but if you demand advice I will for friendship sake give it I think you should now go at once without delay and if Gandalf does not come before you set out then I also advise this do not go alone take such friends as are trusty and willing now you should be grateful for I do not give this counsel gladly the elves have their

          
          04:14:16
          own labors and their own sorrows and they are little concerned with the ways of Hobbits or of any other creatures upon Earth our paths cross their seldom by chance or purpose in this meeting there may be more than chance but the purpose is not clear to me and I fear to say too much I'm deeply grateful said Frodo but I wish you'd tell me plainly what the black riters are are if I take your advice I may not see gandar for a long time and I ought to know what's the danger that pursues me is it not enough

          
          04:14:53
          to know that they are Servants of the enemy answered gildor flee them speak no words to them they are deadly ask no more of me but my heart for boess that a all is ended you Frodo son of Drogo will know more of these fell things than gildor and glorian May bth protect you but where shall I find courage asked Frodo that is what I chiefly need courage is found in unlikely places said gildor be of Good Hope sleep now in the morning we shall have gone but we will send our messages through the lands the

          
          04:15:33
          wandering companies shall know of your journey and those that have power for good shall be on the watch I name you elf friend and may the stars shine upon the end of your road seldom have we had such Delight in strangers and it is fair to hear words of the ancient speech from the lips of other Wanderers in the world Frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking I'll sleep now he said and the elf led him to a bow beside Pippen and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber

          
          04:16:16
          chapter 4 a shortcut to mushrooms in the morning Frodo woke refreshed he was lying in a bar made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground his bed was of Fern and grass deep and soft and strangely fragrant the Sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were still green upon the tree he jumped up and went out Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood Pippen was standing studying the sky and weather there was no sign of the elves they have left us fruit and drink

          
          04:16:53
          and bread said Pippen come and have your breakfast the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night I didn't want to leave you any but Sam insisted froa sat down beside Sam and began to eat what is the plan for today asked Pippen to walk to buckle Bree as quickly as possible answered Frodo and gave his attention to the food do you think we shall see anything of those Riders asked Pippen cheerfully under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them didn't seem very alarming to

          
          04:17:31
          him yes probably said Frodo not liking the reminder but I hope to get across the river without there seeing us did you find out anything about them from gildor not much only hints and riddles said fro evasively did you ask about the sniffing we didn't discuss it said Frodo with his mouth full you should have I'm sure it's very important in that case I'm sure gildor would have refused to explain it said Fredo sharply and now leave me in peace for a bit I don't want to answer a string of questions while I'm eating I

          
          04:18:07
          want to think good Heavens said Pippen at breakfast he walked away towards the edge of the Green from Frodo's mind the bright morning treacherously bright he thought had not banished the fear of pursuit and he pondered the words of gildor the merry voice of pipin came to him he was running on the Green Turf and singing no I could not he said to himself it is one thing to take my young friends walking over the sh with me until we are hungry and weary and food and bed a sweet to take them into Exile

          
          04:18:44
          where hunger and weariness may have no cure is quite another even if they are willing to come The Inheritance is mine alone I don't think I ought even to take Sam he looked at Sam gamji and discovered that Sam was watching him well Sam he said what about it I'm leaving the sh as soon as ever I can in fact I've made up my mind now not even to wait a day at criolo if it can be helped very good sir you still mean to come with me I do it's going to be very dangerous Sam it's already dangerous most likely neither of

          
          04:19:23
          us will come back if you don't come back sir then I Shan that's certain said Sam don't you leave him they said to me leave him I said I never mean to I'm going to stay with him if he climbs to the moon and if any of those Black Riders try to stop him they'll have Sam gamji to reckon with I said they laughed who are they and what are you talking about the elves sir we had some talk last night and they seemed to know you were going away so I didn't see the use of denying it wonderful folk elves are

          
          04:19:58
          wonderful they are said Frodo do you like them still now you have had a closer view they seem a bit above my likes and dislike so to speak answered Sam slowly it don't seem to matter what I think about them they are quite different from what I expected so old and young and so gay and sad as it were Frodo looked at Sam rather startled half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him he didn't sound like the voice of the old Sam gamji that he thought he knew but it looked like the old Sam

          
          04:20:35
          gamji sitting there except that his face was unusually thoughtful do you feel any need to leave the shine now now that your wish to see them has come true already he asked yes sir I don't know how to say it but after last night I feel different I seem to see ahead in a kind of way I know we're going to take a very long road Into Darkness but I know I can't turn back it isn't to see elves now nor dragons nor mountains that I want I don't rightly know what I want but I have something to do before the

          
          04:21:10
          end and it lies ahead not in the sh I must see it through sir if you understand me I don't altogether but I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion I'm content we'll go together Frodo finished his breakfast in silence then standing up he looked over the land ahead and called to Pippin all ready to start he said as pipp and ran up we must be getting off at once we slept late and there are a good many miles to go you slept late you mean said Pippen I was up long before and we're only waiting for you to finish eating

          
          04:21:51
          and thinking I finished both now and I'm going to make for Buckle Bri fery as quickly as possible I'm not going out of the way back to the road we left last night I'm going to cut straight across country from here Ben you are going to fly said Pippen you won't cut straight on foot anywhere in this country we can cut straighter than the road Road anyway answered froder the fer is east from wood Hall but the hard Road curves away to the left you can see a Bend of it away North over there it goes round the

          
          04:22:23
          North End of the Mish so as to strike the causeway from the bridge above stock but that is miles out of the way we could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the ferry from where we stand shortcuts make long delays argued Pippen the country's rough around here and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the marish I know the land in these parts and if you are worrying about Black Riders I can't see that it's any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field it's less easy to find people in

          
          04:22:59
          the woods and Fields answered Frodo and if you are supposed to be on the road there's some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it all right said Pippen I'll follow you into every bog and ditch but it's hard I'd counted on passing the golden perch at stock before Sundown the best beer in the East Farthing or used to be it's a long time since I tasted it that settles it said trodo shortcuts make delays but ins make longer ones at all costs we must keep you away from the golded perch

          
          04:23:33
          we want to get to buckle brid before dark what do you say Sam I'll go along with you Mr Frodo said Sam in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the East Farthing then if we're going to toil through bog and Brier let's go now said Pippen it was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before but clouds were beginning to come up from the West it looked likely to turn to rain The Hobbit scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below their course had been chosen to leave

          
          04:24:09
          wood Hall to their left and to cut slanting through the wood that clustered along the Eastern side of the Hill until they reached the flats Beyond then they could make straight for the ferry over country that was open except for a few ditches and fences Frodo reckoned they had 18 miles to go in a straight line he soon found that the thicket was closer and more Tangled than it had appeared there were no paths in the undergrowth and they didn't get on very fast when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank they found a stream

          
          04:24:43
          running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen they couldn't jump over it nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet scratched and muddy they halted wondering what to do first check said Pippen smiling grimly Sam gamji looked back through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green Bank from which they had climbed down look he said clutching Frodo by the arm they all

          
          04:25:22
          looked and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing beside it stooped a black figure they at once gave up any idea of going back Frodo led the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream he said to Pippen we were both right the shortcut has gone crooked already but we got undercover only just in time you've got sharp ear Sam can you hear anything coming they stood still almost holding their breath as they listened but there was no sound of pursuit I don't fancy he would try

          
          04:26:02
          bringing his horse down that bank said Sam but I guess he knows we came down it we'd better be going on going on was not altogether easy they had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through they were cut off from The Wind by the ridge behind and the air was still and stuffy when they forced their way at last into more open ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going the banks of the stream

          
          04:26:35
          sank as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower wandering off towards the marish and the river why this is the stock Brook said Pippen if we are going to try and get back onto our course we must cross at once and Bear right they waited the stream and hurried over a wide open space Rush grown and treeless on the further side beyond that they came again to a belt of trees Tall Oaks for the most part with here and there an elm tree or an ash the ground was fairly level and there was

          
          04:27:11
          little undergrowth but the trees were too close for them to see far ahead the leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast Sky then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down they trudged along as fast as they could over patches of grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and all about them the rain pattered and trickled they didn't talk but kept glancing back and from side to side after half an hour Pippin said I hope we haven't turned too much toward

          
          04:27:45
          the South and are not walking longwise through this wood it's not a very broad belt I should have said no more than a mile at the widest and we ought to have been through it by now it's no good our starting to go in zigzags said Frodo that won't mend matters let's keep on as we're going I'm not sure that I want to come out into the open yet they went on for perhaps another couple of miles then the Sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened it was now past midday and they felt it was high time for lunch they

          
          04:28:23
          halted under an elm tree its leaves the fast turning yellow were still thick and the ground at its feet was fairly dry and sheltered when they came to make their meal they found that the elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink pale golden in color it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers and was wonderfully refreshing very soon they were laughing and snapping their fingers at rain and at Black Riders the last few miles they felt would soon be behind them Frodo propped his back against the

          
          04:28:57
          tree trunk and closed his eyes Sam and Pippen sat near and they began to hum and then to sing softly ho ho ho to the bottle I go to heal my heart and drown my woe rain may fall and wind May blow and many miles be still to go but under a tall tree I will lie and let the clouds go sailing by ho ho ho they began again louder they stopped short suddenly Frodo sprang to his feet a long drawn whale came down the wind like the Cry of some evil and lonely creature it Rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note even as

          
          04:29:41
          they sat and stood as if suddenly Frozen it was answered by another cry fter and further off but no less chilling to the blood there was then a silence broken only by the sound of the wind and the leaves and what do you think that was Pippen asked at last trying to speak lightly but quavering a little if it was a bird it was one that I've never heard in the Shire before it was not bird or beast said Frodo it was a call or a signal there were words in that cry though I could not catch them but no Hobbit has such a

          
          04:30:18
          voice no more was said about it they were all thinking of the Riders but no one spoke of them they were now reluctant either to stay or go on but sooner or later they had got to get across the Open Country to the ferry and it was best to go sooner and in daylight in a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were off but before long the wood came to a sudden end wide grasslands stretched before them they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the South away over the flats they could Glimpse

          
          04:30:54
          the low Hill of bucklebury across the river but it was now to their left creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees they set off across the open as quickly as they could at first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a Horseman on the ridge dark against the sky but there was no sign of one the sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sank towards the hills they

          
          04:31:27
          had left was now shining brightly again Their Fear left them though they still felt uneasy but the land became steadily more tame and well ordered soon they came into well tendered fields and meadows they were HED and Gates and dkes for drainage everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of the Sha their Spirits rose with every step the line of the river grew nearer and the Black Riders began to seem like Phantoms of the woods now left far behind they passed along the edge of a

          
          04:32:01
          huge turnip field and came to a stout gate Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid Hedges towards a distant clump of trees Pippen stopped I know these fields in this gate he said this is Bam Furlong old farmer maggots land that's his farm away there in the trees one trouble after another said Frodo looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippen had declared the lane was the slot leading to A Dragon's Den the others looked at him in Surprise what's wrong with old maggot asked Pippin he's a good friend to all

          
          04:32:41
          the Brandy bucks of course he's a terror to trespassers and keeps ferocious dogs but after all folk down here and near the border and have to be more on their guard I know said trodo but all the same he added with a shamefaced laugh I'm terrified of him and his dogs I've avoided his farm for years and years he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when I was a Youngster at Brandy Hall on the last occasion he beat me and then took me and showed me to his dogs see Lads he said next time

          
          04:33:15
          this young varet sets foot on my land you can eat him now see him off they chased me all the way to the ferry I've never got over the Fright though I dare say the beasts knew their business and wouldn't really have touched me Pippen laughed well it's time you made it up especially if you're coming back to live in Buckland old baggot is really a stout fellow if you leave his mushrooms alone let get into the lane and then we shant be trespassing if we meet him I'll do the talking he's a friend of Mary's and

          
          04:33:50
          I used to come here with him a good deal at one time they went along the lane until they saw the thatched roves of a large house and farm buildings peeping Out Among the trees ahead the maggots and the PTY foots of stock and most of the inhabitants of the Mish were house dwellers and his farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all around it there was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baing and barking broke out and a loud voice was

          
          04:34:26
          heard shouting grip Fang Wolf come on Lads Frodo and Sam stopped dead but Pippen walked on a few Paces the gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane and dashed towards the Travelers barking fiercely they took no notice of Pippen but Sam shrank against the wall while two wolvish looking dog sniffed at him suspiciously and snarled if he moved the largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of Frodo bristling and growling through the gate there now appeared a broad thick set Hobbit with a

          
          04:35:04
          round red face hello hello and who may you be and what may you be wanting he asked good afternoon Mr maggot said Pippen the farmer looked at him closely well if it isn't Master Pippen Mr peragon toque I should say he cried changing from a scow to a grin it's a long time since I saw you around here it's lucky for you that I know you I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers there are some funny things going on today day of course we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times too near the river he said shaking

          
          04:35:49
          his head but this fellow was the most outlandish I've ever set eyes on he won't cross my land without leave a second time not if I can stop him what fellow do you mean asked Pippin then you haven't seen him said the farmer he went up the lane toward the causeway not a long while back he was a funny customer and asking funny questions but perhaps you'll come along inside and we'll pass the news more comfortable I have a drop of good a on tap if you and your friends are willing Mr toque it seemed plain that the farmer

          
          04:36:25
          would tell them more if allowed to do it in his own time and fashion so they all accepted the invitation what about the dogs asked Frodo anxiously the tharma laughed they won't harm you not unless I tell them to here grip Fang hail he cried hail wolf to the relief of Frodo and Sam the dogs walked away and let them go free Pippen introduced the other two to the farmer Mr Frodo bins he said you may not remember him but he used to live at Brandy Hall at the name baggin the farmer started and gave Frodo a sharp

          
          04:37:06
          glance for a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused and that the dogs would be told to see him off but farmer maggot took him by the arm well if that isn't queerer than ever he exclaimed Mr Baggins is it come inside we must have a talk they went into the Farmer's Kitchen and sat by the wide fireplace Mrs Maggot brought out beer and a huge jug and filled four large mugs it was a good brew and Pippen found himself more than compet ated for missing the golden perch

          
          04:37:44
          Sam sipped his beer suspiciously he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the sh and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master however long ago after a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects which were no worse than usual farmer maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turn now Mr perigrine he said where might you be coming from and where might you be going to were you coming to visit me for if so you'd gone past my gate

          
          04:38:21
          without my seeing you well no answered Pippen to tell you the truth since you've guessed it we got into the lane from the other end we'd come over your Fields but that was quite by accident we lost our way in the woods back near Wood hole trying to take a shortcut to the ferry if you were in a hurry the road would have served you better said the farmer but I wasn't worrying about that you have leave to walk over my land if you ever a mind Mr perigrine and you Mr beggins though I dare say you still like

          
          04:38:56
          mushrooms he laughed ah yes I recognize the name I recollect the time when young Frodo beggins was one of the worst Young Rascals of Buckland but it wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of I had just heard the name beggins before you turned up what do you think that funny customer asked me they waited anxiously for him to go on well the farmer continued approaching his point with slow relish he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door all black he was himself

          
          04:39:37
          too and cloaked and hoarded up as if he didn't want to be known now what in the sh can he want I thought to myself we don't see many of the big folk over the border and anyway I'd never heard of any like this black fellow good day to you I says going out to him this Lane don't lead anywhere and wherever you may be going your quickest way will be back to the road I didn't like the looks of him and when grip came out he took one Sniff and let out a Yelp as if he'd been stung he put down his tail and bolted off howling the black

          
          04:40:18
          fell sat quite still I come from Yonder he said slow and stiff like pointing back West over my Fields if you please have you seen baggin he asked in a queer voice and bent low towards me I couldn't see any face for his hood fell down so low and I felt a sort of shiver down my back but I didn't see why he should come riding over my land so bold be off I said there are no baggin is here you're in the wrong part of the Shire you'd better go back West to hobon but you can go by Road this time bagins has left he

          
          04:41:01
          answered in a whisper he's coming he's not far away I wish to find him if he passes will you tell me I will come come back with gold no you won't I said you'll go back where you belong double quick I give you one minute before I call all my dogs he gave a sort of hiss it might have been laughing and it might not then he spurred his great horse right at me and I jumped out of the way only just in time I called the dogs but he swung off and rode through the gate and up the lane toward the causeway like

          
          04:41:38
          a bat of Thunder what do you think of that Frodo sat for a moment looking at the far but his only thought was how on Earth would they reach the ferry I don't know what to think he said at last then I'll tell you what to think said maggot you should never have gone mixing up yourself with obit and folk Mr Frodo folk are queer up there Sam stirred in his chair and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye but you were always a reckless lad when I heard you had left the brand bucks and gone off to that old

          
          04:42:13
          Mr Bilbo I said that you were going to find trouble mark my words this all comes of those strange doings of Mr Bilbo his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign Parts they say maybe there's some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of hobbiton as I hear Frodo said nothing the shrewed guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting well Mr Frodo maggot went on I'm glad that you've had the sense to come back to Buckland my advises stay here and

          
          04:42:51
          don't get mixed up with those outlandish folk you'll have friends in these parts if any of these black fellas come after you again I'll deal with them I'll say you're dead or I've left the sh or anything you like and that might be true enough for as like as not it's old Mr bbo they want news of maybe you're right said Frodo avoiding the farmer's eye and staring at the fire maggot looked at him thoughtfully well I see you have ideas of your own he said it's as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and

          
          04:43:29
          that Rider here on the same afternoon and maybe my news was no great news to you after all I'm not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep to yourself but I see you're in some kind of trouble perhaps you're thinking it won't be too easy to get to the ferry without being caught I was thinking so said Frodo but we've got to try and get there and it won't be done by sitting and thinking so I'm afraid we must be going thank you very much indeed for your kindness I've been in Terror of you and

          
          04:44:02
          your dogs for over 30 years farmer maggot though you may laugh to hear it it's a pity for I've missed a good friend and now I'm sorry to leave so soon but I'll come back perhaps one day if I get a chance you'll be welcome when you come said maggot but now I have a notion it's near Sundown already and we're going to have our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun if you and Mr peragon and all could stay and have a bite with us we would be pleased and so should we said Frodo but we must be going at once

          
          04:44:40
          I'm afraid even now it will be dark before we can reach the ferry ah but wait a minute I was going to say after a bit of supper I'll get out a small wagon and I'll drive you all to the ferry that will save you a good step and it might also save you trouble of another sort Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully to the relief of Pippen and Sam the sun was already behind the Western Hills and the light was failing two of maggot's sons and his three daughters came in and a generous supper was laid on the large table the kitchen

          
          04:45:18
          was lit with candles and the fire was mended Mrs Maggot bustled in and out one or two other Hobbits belonging to the farm household came in in a short while 14 sat down to eat there was beer in plenty and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon besides much other solid Farmhouse Fair the dogs lay by the fire and Nord rinds and cracked bones when they' finished the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the wagon ready it was dark in the yard when the guests came out they threw their packs on board and climbed in the

          
          04:45:56
          farmer sat in the driving seat and whipped up his two Stout ponies his wife stood in the light of the open door you be careful of yourself maggot she called Don't Go arguing with any foreigners and come straight back I will said he and drove out of the gate there was now no breath of wind stirring the night was still and quiet and a chill was in the air they went without lights and took it slowly after a mile or two the lane came to an end crossing a deep Dyke and climbing a short slope up onto the high banked

          
          04:46:36
          corway maggot got down and took a good look Either Way North and South but nothing could be seen in the darkness and there was not a sound in the still air thin strands of River Mist were hanging above the dkes and crawling over the fields it's going to be thick said maggot but I'll not light my lanterns till I turn for home we'll hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight it was 5 miles or more from maggots Lane to the ferry the hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were strained for any sound above the

          
          04:47:14
          creek of the wheels and the slow clop of the pony's Hooves the wagon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo beside him Pippen was nodding toward sleep but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog they reached the entrance to the fery lane at last it was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right farmer maggot Drew in his ponies and the wagon and creaked to a halt they were just beginning to scramble out when suddenly they heard what they had all been dreading hoofs on the road ahead

          
          04:47:51
          the sound was coming towards them magot jumped down and stood holding the pony's heads and peering forward into the Gloom clip clop clip clop came the approaching Rider the fall of the Hoops sounded loud in the still foggy air you'd better be hidden Mr Frodo said Sam anxiously you get down in the wagon and cover up with bankets and we'll send this Rider to the right ABS he climbed out and went to the farmer side Black Riders would have to ride over him to get near the wagon clip clop clip clop the rider was nearly on them hello there

          
          04:48:30
          cried farmer maggot the advancing hobes stopped short they thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the Mist a yard or two ahead now then said the farmer throwing the rains to Sam and striding forward don't you come a step nearer what do you want and where are you going I want Mr bagin have you seen him said a muffled voice but the voice was the voice of Mary brandybuck a dark Lantern was uncovered and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer Mr Mary he cried yes of course who did you think it

          
          04:49:10
          was said said Mary coming forward as he came out of the Mist and their fears subsided he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary Hobbit's eyes he was riding a pony and the scarf was SED around his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog Frodo sprang out of the wagon to greet him so there you are at last said Mary I was beginning to wonder if you'd turn up at all today and I was just going back to supper when it grew foggy I came across and rode up towards stock to see if you'd fallen in any ditches

          
          04:49:45
          but I'm blessed if I know which way you've come where did you find them Mr maggot in your Duck Pond no I caught them trespassing said the farmer and nearly set my dogs on them but they'll tell you all the story I've no doubt now if you'll excuse me Mr Mary and Mr Frodo and all I'd best be turning for home Mrs Maggot will be Waring with a night getting thick he backed the wagon into the lane and turned it well good night to you all he said it's been a queer day and no mistake but alls well as endswell

          
          04:50:21
          though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors I'll not deny that I'll be glad now when I do he lit his lanterns and got up Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat I was nearly forgetting he said Mrs Maggot put this up for Mr Baggins with a their compliments he handed it down and moved off followed by a chorus of thanks and good nights they watched the pale rings of Light Round his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy night suddenly Frodo laughed from the

          
          04:50:56
          covered basket he held the scent of mushrooms was Rising chapter 5 a conspiracy on Mark asked now we'd better get home ourselves said Mary there's something funny about all this I see but it must wait till we get in they turned down the ferry Lane which was straight and well-kept and edged with large whitewashed stones in a 100 yards or so it brought them to the river bank where there was a broad wooden Landing stage a large flat fedy boat was mored beside it the white bards near the water's edge glimmered in

          
          04:51:43
          the light of two lamps on high posts behind them The Mists in the flat Fields were now above the hedges but the water before them was dark with only a few curling wisps like steam among the Reeds by the bank there seemed to be less fog on the further side Mary led the pony over the gangway onto the ferry and the others followed Mary then pushed slowly off with a long Pole the Brandy Wine flowed slow and Broad before them on the other side the bank was Steep and up at a winding path climbed from the further Landing lamps

          
          04:52:22
          were twinkling there behind loomed up the Buck Hill and out of it through stray shrouds of mist sha many round windows yellow and red they were the windows of Brandy Hall the ancient home of the Brandy box long ago G and Dad old Buck Head of the old Buck family one of the oldest in the marish OR indeed in the Sha had crossed the river which was the original boundary of the land eastwards he built and excavated Brandy Hall changed his name to brandyb and settled down to become master of what was virtually a

          
          04:53:01
          small independent country his family grew and grew and after his days continued to grow until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the Hill and had three large front doors many side doors and about 100 Windows the Brandy box and their numerous dependants then began to borrow and later to build all round about that was the origin of Buckland a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old Forest a sort of colony from the sh its Chief Village was bucklebury clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy

          
          04:53:39
          Hall the people people in the marish were friendly with the bucklands and the authority of the master of the hall as the head of the brandybuck family was called was still acknowledged by the farmers between stock and Rashi but most of the folk of the old sha regarded the Buckland as peculiar half foreigners as it were though as a matter of fact they were not very different from the other Hobbits of the for farings except in one point they were fond of boats and some of them could swim their land was originally unprotected

          
          04:54:14
          from the East but on that side they had built a hedge the high hay it had been planted many generations ago and was now thick and tall for it was constantly tended it ran all the way from Brandywine bridge in a big loop curving away from the river to Hayes end where the withy Windle flowed out of the forest into the Brandy Wine well over 20 M from end to end but a of course it was not a complete protection the forest Drew close to the Hedge in many places the Buckland has kept their doors locked

          
          04:54:49
          after dark and that also was not usual in the Sha the ferry boat moved slowly across the water the Buckland sh D Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before he had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling streams slipped by his old life lay behind in The Mists Dark Adventure lay in front he scratched his head and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr Frodo could have gone on living quietly at Bag [Music] End the four Hobbits stepped off the ferry Mary was tying it up and Pippen

          
          04:55:32
          was already leading the pony up The Path when Sam who had been looking back as if to take farewell of the sh said in a horar whisper look back Mr Frodo do you see anything on the far stage under the distant lamps they could just make out a figure it looked like a dark black bundle left behind but as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that as if searching the ground it then crawled or went crouching back into the Gloom beyond the lamps what in the Shire is that exclaimed Mary something that is

          
          04:56:12
          following us said Frodo but don't ask anymore now let's get away at once they hurried up the path to the top of the bank but when they looked back the far Shore was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen thank goodness you don't keep any boats on the West Bank said Frodo can horses cross the river they can go 20 M North to Brandy Wine Bridge or they might swim answered Mary though I never heard of any horse swimming the Brandy Wine but what have horses to do with it I'll tell you later let's get

          
          04:56:46
          indoors and then we can talk all right you and Pippen know your way so I'll just ride on and tell fatty balger that you're coming we'll see about supper and things we had our supper early with farmer maggot said Frodo but we could do with another you shall have it give me that basket said Mary and rode ahead into the Darkness it was some distance from the Brandy Wine to Frodo's new house at cric Hollow they passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left and on the outskirts of bucklebury struck the main road of

          
          04:57:25
          Buckland that ran south from the bridge half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their right this they followed for a couple of Miles as it climbed up and down into the country at last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge nothing could be seen of the house in the dark it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge Frodo had chosen it because it stood in an outof theeway corner of the country

          
          04:57:59
          and there were no other dwellings close by you could get in and out without being noticed it had been built a long while before by the Brandy Bock for the use of guests or members of of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of Brandy hall for a time it was an old-fashioned countryfied house as much like a hobit hole as possible it was long and low with no upper story and it had a roof of turf round windows and a large round door as they walked up the Green Path from the gate no light was visible the

          
          04:58:35
          windows were dark and shuttered Frodo knocked on the door and fatty b soier opened it a friendly light streamed out they slipped in quickly and shut themselves on the light inside they were in a wide Hall with doors on either side in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house well what do you think of it asked Mary coming up the passage we've done our best in a short time to make it look like home after all fatty and I only got here with the last cartload yesterday Frodo looked round it did look like home

          
          04:59:15
          many of his own favorite things or Bilbo's things they reminded him sharply of him in their new setting were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End it was a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon indeed at once yet that would have to be done that very night before

          
          04:59:50
          they all went to bed it's delightful he said with an effort I hardly feel that I have moved at all the Travelers hung up their cloaks and piled their packs on the floor Mary LED them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end Fire Light came out and a puff of steam a bath cried Pippen oh blessed maradok which order shall we go in said Frodo eldest first or quickest first you'll be last either way Master perigrine trust me to arrange things better than that said Mary we can't begin life at cric holla with a quarrel

          
          05:00:31
          over baths in that room there are three tubs and a cuper full of boiling water there are also towels mats and soap get inside and be quick Mary and fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage and busied themselves with the final preparations for late supper snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with a sound of splashing and wallowing the voice of Pippen was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbo's favorite bath songs sing hey for the bath at close of

          
          05:01:08
          day that washes the weary mud away aloon is he that will not sing Oh water hot is a noble thing oh sweet is the sound of falling rain and the brook that leaps from Hill to plain but better than rain or Rippling streams is water heart that smokes and stams oh water cold we may pour it need down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed but better is beer if drink we lack and water hot poured down the back a water is fair that leaps on high in a fountain white beneath the sky but never did Fountain sound so sweet splashing H

          
          05:01:49
          water with my feet there was a terrific Splash and a shout of whoo from Frodo it appeared that a lot of Pippin bath had imitated a fountain and leapt on high medy went to the door what about supper and beer in the throat he called Frodo came out drying his hair there's so much water in the air that I'm coming into the kitchen to finish he said locks said Mary looking in the stone floor was swimming you ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat perigrine he said hurry up or we Shan wait for

          
          05:02:30
          you they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire I suppose you three won't want mushrooms again said freder go without much hope yes we shall cried Pippen they're mine said Frodo given to me by Mrs Maggot a queen among Farmers wives take your greedy hands away and I'll serve them Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassing even the greediest likings of big people a fact which partly explains young Frodo's long expeditions to the renowned fields of the madish and the wroth of the injured

          
          05:03:08
          maggot on this occasion the there was plenty for all even according to Hobbit standards there were also many other things to follow and when they'd finished even fatty Baler heaved a sigh of content they pushed back the table and Drew chairs around the fire we'll clear up later said Mary now tell me all about it I guess that you've been having Adventures which was not quite Fair without me I want a full account and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old maggot and why he spoke to me like that he sounded

          
          05:03:43
          almost as if he was scared if that is possible we have all been scared said Pippen after a pause in which froda stared at the fire and did not speak you would have been too if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders and what are they black figures riding on black horses answered Pippin if Frodo won't talk I'll tell you the whole tale from the beginning he then gave a full account of their Journey from the time when they left hobbiton Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations froda remained

          
          05:04:22
          silent I should think you were making it all up said Mary if I hadn't seen that black shape on the landing stage and heard the queer sound in maggot's voice what do you make of it all Frodo cousin Frodo has been very close said Pippen but the time has come for him to open out so far we've been given nothing more to go on than farmer maggots guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo's treasure that was only a guess said Frodo hastily maggot does not know anything old maggot is a shrewd fellow said Mary a lot goes on

          
          05:05:01
          behind his round face that doesn't come out in his talk I've heard that he used to go into the Old Forest at one time and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things but you can at least tell us Frodo whether you think his guest good or bad I think answered Frodo slowly that it was a good guess as far as it goes there is a connection with Bilbo's old adventures and the Riders are looking or perhaps one ought to say searching for him or for me I also fear if you want to know that it's

          
          05:05:36
          no joke at all and that I'm not safe here or anywhere else he looked round at the windows and walls as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way the others looked at him in silence and exchanged meaning glances among themselves it's coming out in a minute whispered Pippin to Mary Mary nodded well said Frodo at last sitting up and straightening his back as if he had made a decision I can't keep it dark any longer I've got something to tell you all but I don't quite know how to begin I think I could help you said Mary

          
          05:06:14
          quietly by telling you some of it myself what do you mean said Frodo looking at him anxiously just this my dear old Frodo you're miserable because you don't know how to say goodbye you meant to leave the sh of course but danger has come on you sooner than you expected and now you're making up your mind to go at once and you don't want to we're very sorry for you Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again his look of surprise was so comical that they laughed dear old Frodo said Pippen did you really think that you'd thrown dust

          
          05:06:53
          in all our eyes you haven't been nearly careful or clever enough for that you've obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your halts all this year since April we've constantly heard you muttering shall I ever look down down into that Valley again I wonder and things like that and pretending that you'd come to the end of your money and actually selling your beloved bag in to those sackful bines and all those close talks with Gandalf good Heavens said Frodo I thought I'd been both careful and clever

          
          05:07:30
          I don't know what Gandalf would say is all the sh discussing my departure then oh no said Mary don't worry about that the secret won't keep for long of course but at present it is I think only known to us conspirators after all you must remember that we know you well and are often with you we can usually guess what you're thinking I knew Bilbo too to tell you the truth I'd been watching you rather closely ever since he left I thought you'd go after him sooner or later indeed I expected you to go sooner

          
          05:08:07
          and lately we've been very anxious we've been terrified that you might give us the slip and go off suddenly all on your own like he did ever since this spring we've kept our eyes open and done a good deal of planning on our own account ah you're not going to escape so easily but I must said Frodo it can't be helped dear friends it's wretched for us all but it's no use you're trying to keep me since you've guessed so much please help me and don't hinder me you don't understand said Pippen you must go

          
          05:08:44
          and therefore we must too marry and I are coming with you Sam is an excellent fell and would jump down a dragon's throat to save you if he didn't trip over his own feet but you'll need more than one companion in your dangerous Adventures my dear and most beloved Hobbits said Frodo deeply moved but I couldn't allow it I decided that long ago too you speak of danger but you don't understand this is no Treasure Hunt No there and back Journey I'm flying from deadly Peril into deadly Peril of course we understand said Mary

          
          05:09:25
          firmly that's why we've decided to come we know the ring is no laughing matter but we're going to do our best to help you against the enemy the ring said Frodo now completely amazed yes the ring said Mary my dear old Hobbit you don't allow for the inquisitiveness of friends I've known about the existence of the ring for years before Bilbo went away in fact but since he obviously regarded it as secret I kept the knowledge in my head until we formed our conspiracy I didn't know Bilbo of course as well as I know you I was too young

          
          05:10:06
          and he was also more careful but he wasn't careful enough if you want to know how I first found out I'll tell you go on said Roa fly it was the Sackville baggin's that were as downfall as you might expect one day a year before the party I happened to be walking along the road when I saw billbo ahead suddenly in the distance the spbs appeared coming towards us billbo slowed down and then hey Presto he vanished I was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but I got through the Hedge and

          
          05:10:47
          walked along the field inside I was peeping through into the road after the SBS had passed and was looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared I caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser pocket after that I kept my eyes open in fact I confess I spied but you must admit that it was very intriguing and I was only in my teens I must be the only one in the Shire besides you Frodo that's ever seen the old fellow's secret book you read his book cried Frodo good heavens above is nothing safe not too

          
          05:11:26
          safe I should say said Mary but I've only had one rapid glance and that was difficult to get he never left the book about I wonder what became of it I should like another look have you got it Frodo no it wasn't at Bag End he must have taken it away well as I was saying Mary proceeded I kept my knowledge to myself till this spring when things got serious then we formed our conspiracy and as we were serious too and meant business we've not been too scrupulous you're not a very easy nut to crack and gandal is worse but if you

          
          05:12:07
          want to be introduced to our chief investigator I can produce him where is he said Frodo looking round as if he expected a masked and Sinister figure to come out of a cupboard step forward Sam said Mary and Sam stood up with a face Scarlet up to the ears here is our collector of information and he collected a lot I can tell you before he was finally caught after which I may say he seemed to regard himself as on parole and Dy up Sam cried Frodo feeling that amazement could go no further and quite

          
          05:12:45
          unable to decide whether he felt angry amused relieved or merely foolish yes sir said Sam begging your pardon sir but I meant no wrong to you Mr Frodo nor to Mr gandal for that matter he has some sense mind you and when you said go alone he said no take someone as you can trust but it doesn't seem that I can trust anyone said Frodo Sam looked at him unhappily it all depends on what you want put in Mary you can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin to The Bitter End and you can trust us to

          
          05:13:24
          keep any secret of yours closer than you keep it yourself but you can't trust us to let you face trouble alone and go off without a word where are your friends Frodo anyway there it is we know most of what Gandalf has told you we know a good deal about the ring we're horribly afraid but we're coming with you or following you like hounds and after all sir added Sam you did ought to take the elves advice gildor said you should take them as was willing and you can't deny it I don't deny it said Frodo looking at Sam who

          
          05:14:04
          was now grinning I don't deny it but I'll never believe you're sleeping again whether you snore or or not I'll kick you hard to make sure you are a set of deceitful Scoundrels he said turning to the others but bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms I give in I'll take gildor advice if the danger weren't so dark I should dance for joy even so I can't help feeling happy happier than I've felt for a long time I dreaded this evening good that's settled three sweet cheers for Captain Frodo and Company

          
          05:14:42
          they shouted and they danced around him medy and Pippen began a song which they had apparently got ready for the occasion it was made on the model of the dwarf song that started Bilbo on his Adventure long ago and went to the same tune farewell we call to Heth and Hall the wind May blow and Rain may fall we must away a break of day far over wood and Mountain tall to Riv Andel where elves yet dwell in Glades beneath the Misty fell through more and waste we ride in haste and with then we cannot tell with foes ahead behind us dread

          
          05:15:25
          Beneath The Sky shall be our bed until at last our toil be past our journey done our aand sped we must away we must away we ride before the break of day very good said Frodo but in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed under a roof for tonight at any rate oh that was poetry said Pippen do you really mean to start before the break of day I don't know answered Frodo I fear those Black Riders and I'm sure it's unsafe to stay in one place long especially in the place to which it's

          
          05:16:07
          known I was going also so gildor advised me not to wait but I should very much like to see Gandalf I could see that even gildor was Disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared it really depends on two things how soon could the Riders get to bucklebury and how soon could we get off it'll take a good deal of preparation they answer to the second question said Mary is that we could get off in an hour I've prepared practically everything the there are six ponies in a stable across the fields stares and

          
          05:16:42
          Tackle are all packed except for a few extra clothes and the perishable food it seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy said Frodo but what about the Black Riders would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf that all depends on what you think the Riders would do if they found you here answered Mary they could have reached here by now of course if they weren't stopped at the North Gate where the Hedge runs down to the river bank just this side of the bridge the gate guards wouldn't let them through by

          
          05:17:15
          night though they might break through even in the daylight they'd try to keep them out I think at any rate until they got a message through to the master of the hall for they wouldn't like the look of the Riders and would certainly be frightened by them but of course Buckland can't resist a determined attack for long and it's possible that in the morning even a black ride that rode up and asked for Mr bins would be let through it's pretty generally known that you're coming back to live at cric Hollow Frodo sat for a while in

          
          05:17:52
          thought I've made up my mind he said finally I'm starting tomorrow as soon as it's light but I'm not going by Road it would be safer to wait here than that if I go through the north gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once instead of being secret for several days at least as it might be and what's more the bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not we don't know how many there are but there are at least two and possibly more

          
          05:18:26
          the only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected Direction but that can only mean going into the Old Forest said friger horrified you can't be thinking of doing that it's quite as dangerous as Black Riders not quite said Mary it sounds very desperate but I believe Frodo's right it's the only way of getting off without being followed at once with luck we might get a considerable start but you won't have any luck in the Old Forest objected friger no one ever has luck in there you'll get lost people

          
          05:19:06
          don't go in there oh yes they do said Mary the Brandy bucks go in occasionally when the fit takes them we have a private entrance Frodo went in once long ago I've been in several times usually in daylight of course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet well do as you think best said feder I'm more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about the stories about it are a nightmare but my vote hardly counts as I'm not going on the journey still I am very glad someone is stopping behind who can tell gandal

          
          05:19:46
          what you've done when he turns up as I'm sure he will before long fond as he was of Frodo fatty Baler had no desire to leave the Sha nor to see what lay outside it his family came from the East faring from Buford in Bridge fields in fact but he' never been over the Brandy Wine Bridge his task according to the original plans of the conspirators was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and to keep up as long as possible the pretense that Mr Baggins was still living at criolo itd even brought along some old

          
          05:20:23
          clothes of froos to help him in playing the part they little thought how dangerous that part might prove excellent said Frodo when he understood the plan we couldn't have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise I don't know whether these riters can read or not of course but I shouldn't have dared to risk a written message in case they got in and searched the house but if fat is willing to hold the fort and I can be sure of gandal knowing the way we've gone that decides me I'm going into the

          
          05:20:55
          Old Forest first thing tomorrow well that's that said Pippen on the whole I'd rather have our job than fatties waiting here till Black Riders come you wait till you're well inside the forest said freder you'll wish you were back with me before this time tomorrow it's no good arguing about it anymore said Mary we've still got a tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing before we get to bed I shall call you all before the break of day when at last he'd got to bed Frodo couldn't sleep for some time his legs

          
          05:21:34
          ached he was glad that he was riding in the morning eventually fell into a vague dream in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of Tangled trees down below Among The Roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling he felt they would smell him out sooner or later then he heard a noise in the distance at first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest then he knew that it was not leaves but the sound of the sea far off the sound he'd never heard in waking

          
          05:22:08
          light life though it had often troubled his dreams suddenly he found he was out in the open there were no trees after all he was on a dark Heath and there was a strange salt smell in the air looking up he saw before him a tall White Tower standing alone on a High Ridge a great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the sea he started to struggle up the ridge toward the tower but suddenly a light came in the sky and there were was a noise of Thunder chapter six the Old Forest froda woke

          
          05:22:51
          suddenly it was still dark in the room Mary was standing there with a candle in one hand and banging on the door with the other all right what is it said Frodo still shaken and bewildered what is it cried Mary it's time to get up it's halfast 4 and very foggy come on Sam's already getting breakfast ready even Pippen is up I'm just going to saddle of ponies and fetch the one that's to be the baggage carrier wake that sluggard fatty at least he must get up and see us off soon after 6:00 the five Hobbits

          
          05:23:31
          were ready to start fatty Bulger was still yawning they stole quietly out of the house Mary went in front leading a laden Pony and took his way along a path that went through a spinny behind the house and then cut across several Fields the leaves of trees were glistening and every twig was Dripping the grass was gray with cold Dew everything was still and Far Away noises seemed near and clear fowls chattering in a yard someone closing a door of a distant house in their shed they found the ponies sturdy little Beasts of the kind

          
          05:24:09
          loved by Hobbits not speedy but good for a Long Day's Work they mounted and soon they were riding off into the Mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them after riding for about an hour slowly and without talking they saw the Hedge looming suddenly ahead it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs how are you going to get through this asked friger follow me said Mary and you'll see he turned to the left along the Hedge and soon they came to a point where it bent

          
          05:24:47
          inwards running along the lip of a hollow a cutting had been made at some distance from the Hedge and went sloping gently down into the ground it had walls of brick at the sides which rose steadily until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side here fatty Baler halted goodbye Frodo he said I wish you weren't going into the forest I only hope you'll not need rescuing before the day's out but good luck to you today and

          
          05:25:25
          every day if there are no worse things ahead than the old Forest I shall be lucky said Frodo tell gandal to hurry along the east road we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can goodbye they cried and rode down the slope and disappeared from freda's sight into the tunnel it was dark and damp at the far end it was closed by a gate of thick set iron bars Mary got down and unlocked the gate and when they all passed through he pushed it to again it shut with a clang and the lock clicked the sound was

          
          05:26:03
          ominous there said Mary you've left the sh and are now outside on the edge of the Old Forest are the stories about it true asked Pippen I don't know what stories you mean Mary answered if you mean the old bogey stories Fatty's nurses used to tell him about goblins and wolves and things of that sort I should say no at any rate I don't believe them but the forest is queer everything in it very much more alive more aware of what's going on so to speak than things are in the sh and the trees don't like strangers they watch

          
          05:26:44
          you they're usually content merely to watch you as long as daylight lasts and don't do much occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or stick a root out or grasp at you with a Long Trailer but at night things can be most alarming or so I'm told I've only once or twice been in here after dark and then only near the Hedge I thought all the trees were whispering to each other passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language and the branches swayed and groped without any wind they

          
          05:27:22
          do say the trees do actually move and can surround strangers and hem them in in fact long ago they attacked the Hedge they came and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it but the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge after that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly there's still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made is it only the trees that are

          
          05:27:56
          dangerous asked Pippen there are various queer things living deep in the forest and on the far side said Mary or at least I've heard so but I haven't seen any of them but some things make paths whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion not far from this tunnel there is or was for a long time the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the bonfire Glade and then on more or less in our Direction East and little North that is

          
          05:28:34
          the path I'm going to try and find the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide Hollow on the far side was a faint path leading up onto the floor of the forest 100 yards and more beyond the Hedge but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees looking back they could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes straight or bent Twisted leaning squat

          
          05:29:09
          or Slender smooth or gnarled and branched and all the stems were green or gray with moss and slimy Shaggy growths Mary alone seemed fairly cheerful you'd better lead on and find that path froda said to him don't let's lose one another or forget which way the Hedge lies they picked away among the trees and their ponies plotted along carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing Roots there was no undergrowth the ground was Rising steadily and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller

          
          05:29:44
          darker and thicker there was no sound except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves for the moment there was no Whispering or movement among the branches but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval deepening to dislike and even enmity the feeling steadily grew until they found themselves looking up quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow there was not as yet any sign of a path and the trees seemed constantly to

          
          05:30:20
          Bar their way Pippen suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer and without warning let out a shout oi oi he cried I'm not going to do anything just let me pass through will you the others halted startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before I shouldn't shout if I were you said Mary it does more harm than good froda began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through and if

          
          05:31:00
          he'd been right to make the others come into this abominable wood Mary was looking from side to side and seemed already uncertain which way to go Pippin noticed it it hasn't taken you long to lose us he said but at that moment Mary gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead well well he said these trees do shift there is the bonfire Glade in front of us or I hope so but the path to it seems to have moved away the light grew clearer as they went forward suddenly they came out of the trees and found them themselves in a

          
          05:31:39
          wide circular space there was sky above them blue and clear to their surprise for Down Under the forest roof they'd not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the Mist the sun was not however high enough yet to shine down into the clearing though its light was on the Treetops the leaves were all thicker and Greener about the edges of the Glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall no tree grew there only rough grass and many tall plants stalky and faded hemlocks and wood parsley fire weed seeding into

          
          05:32:17
          fluffy ashes and rampant Nettles and thistles a dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheerful Garden after the close Forest the hobbits felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky at the far side of the Glade there was a break in the wall of trees and and a clear path Beyond it they could see it running on into the wood wide in places and open above though every now and again the trees Drew in and overshadowed it with a dark boughs up this path they rode they

          
          05:32:53
          were still climbing gently but they now went much quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them that the forest had relented and was going to let them pass unhindered after all but after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy the trees Drew close again on either side and they could no longer see far ahead now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them so silent was it that the fall of their ponies whoes rustling on Dead Leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden Roots seemed to thud

          
          05:33:30
          in their ears froda tried to sing a song to encourage them but his voice sank to a murmur oh what wanders in the shadowed land despair not for though dark they stand all Woods there be must end at last and see the open sun go past the Setting Sun the Rising Sun for days and or the day beun for East or West all Woods must fade [Music] fail fail even as he said the word his voice faded into silence the air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome just behind them a Long Branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a

          
          05:34:25
          crash into the path the trees seemed to close in before them they don't like all that about ending and failing said Mary I shouldn't sing anymore at present wait till we do get to the edge and then we'll turn and give them a rousing chorus if he felt any great anxiety he didn't show it the others didn't answer they were depressed a heavy weight was settling steadily on Frodo's heart and he regretted now with every step forward that he'd ever thought of challenging the Menace of the trees he was indeed just about to stop

          
          05:35:03
          and propose going back if that was still possible when things took a new turn the path stopped climbing and became for a while nearly level the dark trees Drew aside and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward before them but some distance off there stood a green Hilltop treeless Rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood the path seemed to be making directly for it they now hurried forward again delighted with a thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the forest

          
          05:35:41
          the path dipped and then again began to climb upwards leading them at last to the foot of the Steep Hillside there it left the trees and faded into the turf the wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that entered sharply in a circle around a shaven crown the hobbits LED their ponies up winding round and round until they reached the top there they stood and gazed about them the air was gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they couldn't see to any great distance near at hand the Mist was now almost gone though here and there it lay

          
          05:36:19
          in Hollows of the wood and to the south of them out of a deep fold cutting right across the forest the fog still Rose like steam or wisps of white smoke that said Mary pointing with his hand that's the line of the withy Windle it comes down out of the downs and flows Southwest through the midst of the forest to join the Brandy Wine below Haz end we don't want to go that way the Woody Windle Valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood the center from which all the queerness comes as it were the others looked in

          
          05:36:57
          the direction that Mary pointed out but they could see little but Mists Over The Damp and deep cut Valley and Beyond it the southern half of the forest faded from view the sun on the hilltop was now getting hot it must have been about 11:00 but the Autumn Haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions in the west they couldn't make out either the line of the hedge or the Valley of the Brandy Wine Beyond it northward where they looked most hopefully they could see nothing that might be the line of the Great East Road

          
          05:37:34
          for which they were making they were on an island in a sea of trees and the Horizon was veiled on the Southeastern side the ground fell very steeply as if the slopes of the Hill were continued far down under the trees like Island Shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep Waters they sat on the green Edge and looked out over the woods below them while they ate their midday meal as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the East the gray green lines of the D

          
          05:38:08
          that lay Beyond The Old Forest on that side that cheered them greatly for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the woods borders though they didn't mean to go that way if they could help it the Barrow Downs had a Sinister a reputation in Hobbit Legend as the forest itself at length they made up their minds to go on again the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side but they hadn't followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the

          
          05:38:41
          right soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading toward the withy Windle Valley not at all the direction they wish to take after some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward for although they hadn't been able to see it from the hilltop the road must lie that way and it couldn't be many miles off also northward and to the left of the path the land seemed to be drier and more open climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner and Pines and Furs

          
          05:39:15
          replaced the Oaks and Ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood at first their choice seemed to be good they got along at a fair speed though whenever they got a glimpse of the Sun in an open Glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards but after a Time the trees began to close in again just where they' appeared from a distance to be thinner and less Tangled then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly like the ruts of great giant wheels or wide moats

          
          05:39:49
          and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles these lay usually right across their line of March and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again which was Troublesome and difficult with their ponies each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and mattered undergrowth which somehow wouldn't yield to the left but only gave way when they turned to the right and they had to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further Bank each time they

          
          05:40:22
          clambered out the tree seemed deeper and darker and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way and they were forced to the right and downwards after an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction though they knew well enough that they'd long ceased to go northward at all they were headed off and were simply following a course chosen for them eastwards and southwards Into the Heart of the forest and not out of it the afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and

          
          05:40:57
          stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met it was so Steep and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again either forwards or backwards without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind all they could do was to follow the fold downwards the ground grw soft and in places boggy Springs appeared in the banks and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed then the ground began to fall rapidly and the brook growing strong and noisy flowed

          
          05:41:33
          and leaped swiftly downhill they were in a deep dim lit galy overarched by trees high above them after stumbling along for some way along the stream they came quite suddenly out of the Gloom as if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cliff in a high steep Bank almost a cliff at its feet was a wide space of grass and reads and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep a golden afternoon of late

          
          05:42:09
          sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between in the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown Water bordered with ancient Willows arched over with Willows blocked with Fallen Willows and flecked with thousands of faded willow leaves the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley and the reads were rustling and The Willow bow were creaking well now I have at least some notion of where we are said

          
          05:42:42
          Mary we've come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended this is the river withy wendle I'll go on and explore he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses after a while he reappeared and reported that there was fairly Solid Ground between the cliff foot and the river in some places firm Turf went down to the water's edge what's more he said there seems to be something like a footpath winding Along on this side of the river if we turn left and follow it we shall be bound to

          
          05:43:17
          come out on the east side of the forest eventually I dare say said Pippen that is if the track goes on so far and doesn't simply lead us into a bog and leave us there who made the track do you suppose and why I'm sure it wasn't for our benefit I'm getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything in it and I begin to believe all the stories about it and have you any idea how far Eastward we should have to go no said Mary I haven't I don't know in the least how far down the withy Windle we are or who could possibly come

          
          05:43:55
          here often enough to make a path along it but there's no other way out that I can see or think of there being nothing else for it they filed out and Mary LED them to the path that he discovered everywhere the Reeds and grasses were Lush and tall in places far above their heads but once found the path was easy to follow as it turned and twisted picking out the sound ground among the bogs and pools here and there it passed over other reals running down gullies into the withy Windle out of the higher

          
          05:44:29
          Forest lands and at these points there were tree trunks or bundles of Brushwood laid carefully across the hobbits began to feel very hot there were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing around their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs at last they came suddenly into a thin shade great gray branches reached across the path each step forward became more reluctant than the last sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and

          
          05:45:06
          eyes Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod just in front of him Pippen fell forward onto his knees Frodo halted it's no good he heard Mary saying can't go on another step without rest must have nap it's cool Under The Willows less fles Frodo didn't like the sound of this come on he cried we can't have a nap yet we must get clear of the Forest first but the others were too far gone to care beside them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him his head swam

          
          05:45:52
          there now seemed hardly a sound in the air the Flies had stopped buzzing only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered seemed to stir in the bows above he lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge Willow Tree old and Hoy enormous it looked its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long fingered hands its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved the leaves fluttering against the bright Sky dazzled him and

          
          05:46:31
          he toppled over lying where he fell upon the grass Mary and Pippen dragged themselves forward and laid down with their backs to the willow trunk behind them the great cracks gaped wide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked they looked up at the gray and yellow leaves moving softly against the light and singing they shut their eyes and then it seemed that they could almost hear words cool words saying something about water and sleep they gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot

          
          05:47:06
          of the Great gray Willow Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering him then with an effort he struggled to his feet again he felt a compelling desire for cool water wait for me Sam he stammered must bathe feet a minute half in a dream he wandered forward to the Riverwood side of the tree where great winding Roots grew out into the stream like niled dragonets straining down to drink he straddled one of these and paddled his hot feet in the cool Brown water and there he too

          
          05:47:43
          suddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree Sam sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a cavern he was worried the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny there's more behind this and sun and warm air he muttered to himself I don't like this great big tree I don't trust it how could it singing about sleep now this won't do it all he pulled himself to his feet and staggered off to see what had become of the ponies he found that two had wandered on a good

          
          05:48:22
          way along the path and he just caught them and brought them back toward the others when he heard two noises one loud and the other soft but very clear one was a splash of something heavy falling into the water the other was a noise is like the Snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast he rushed back to the bank throo was in the water close to the edge and a great tree root seemed to be over him and holding him down but he was not struggling Sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from under

          
          05:48:54
          the root and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank almost at once he woke and coughed and spluttered do you know Sam he said at length the beastly tree threw me in in I felt it the big root just Twisted round and tipped me in you were dreaming I expect Mr Frodo said Sam you shouldn't sit in such a place if you feel sleepy what about the others Frodo asked I wonder what sort of Dreams they're having they went round to the other side of the tree and then Sam understood the click that he had heard Pippin had

          
          05:49:32
          vanished The Crack by which he had laid himself had closed together so that not a CH could be seen medy was trapped another crack had closed about his waist his legs lay outside but the rest of him was inside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like a pair of pins Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree trunk where Pippen had Lin then they struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor Mary it was quite useless what a foul thing to happen cried Frodo wildly why did we ever come

          
          05:50:06
          into this Dreadful Forest I wish we're all back at trick Hollow he kicked the tree with all his strength heedless of his own feet a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches the leaves rustled and whispered but with a sound now of faint and far off laughter I suppose we haven't got an A among our luggage Mr Frodo said Sam I brought little Hatchet for chopping firewood said froa that wouldn't be much use wait a minute cried Sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood we might do something with fire

          
          05:50:42
          we might said Frodo doubtfully we might succeed in roasting Pippen live inside we might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with said Sam fiercely if it don't let them go I'll have it down if I have to know it he ran to the ponies and before long came back with two Tinder boxes and a hatchet quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves and bits of bark and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks these they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners as soon as Sam had struck a

          
          05:51:18
          spark into the Tinder it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up the Twigs crackled Little Fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it a Tremor ran through the whole Willow the leaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and anger a loud scream came from Mary and from Far inside the tree they heard Pippen give a muffled yell put it out put it out cried Mary he'll squeeze me in too if you don't he says so who what shouted Frodo rushing round

          
          05:51:57
          to the other side of the tree put it out put it out begged Mary the branches of the willow began to sway violently there was a sound as of a wind Rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet Slumber of the river valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest Sam kicked at the little fire and Stamped Out the Sparks but Frodo without any clear idea of why he did so or what he hoped for ran along

          
          05:52:28
          the path crying help help help it seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice it was blown away from him by the Willow Wind and drowned in a clamor of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth he felt desperate lost and witless suddenly he stopped there was an answer or so he thought but it seemed to come from behind him a away down the path further back in the forest he turned around and listened and soon there could be no doubt someone was singing a song a deep glad voice was

          
          05:53:05
          singing carelessly and happily but it was singing Nonsense hey do mer doll ring ring hop along the willow T Jolly Tom tomillo half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger Frodo and Sam now both Stood Still suddenly out of a long string of nonsense words or so they seemed The Voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song hey come a merry doll Dairy doll my darling light goes the weather wind and the FEA Starling down along Underhill shining in the sunlight waiting on the doorstep for the cold Starlight there my

          
          05:53:56

          05:54:47
          there was another burst of song and then suddenly hopping and dancing along the path there appeared above the reads an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band with another hop and abound there came into view a man or so it seemed at any rate he was too large and heavy for a Hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of the big people though he made noise enough for one stomping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs and charging through grass and rushes like a cow

          
          05:55:18
          going down to drink he had a blue coat and a long brown beard his eyes were blue and bright and his face was red as a ripe Apple but creased with aund wrinkles of laughter in his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white water lies help cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands stretched out steady there cried the old man holding up one hand and they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff now my little fellows where be you are going to puffing like a Bellows what's

          
          05:55:56
          the matter here then do you know who I am I'm Tom Bombadil tell me what's your trouble Tom's in a hurry now don't you crush my lies my friends are caught in the willow tree cried Frodo breathless Master Mary's been squeezed in a crack cried Sam what shouted Tom Bombadil leaping up in the air old man Willow not worse than that e that can soon be mended I know the tune for him old gray Willow man I'll freeze his marrow cold if he don't behave himself I'll sing his roots off I'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and Branch away old man

          
          05:56:36
          Willow setting down his lies carefully on the grass he ran to the tree there he saw Mary's feet still sticking out the rest had already been drawn further inside Tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low voice they could not catch the words but evidently Mary was aroused his legs began to kick Tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging Branch smoke the side of the willow with it you let them out again old man Willow he said what be you a thinking of you should not be wicking

          
          05:57:12
          eat Earth dig deep drink water go to sleep Bombadil is talking he then seized Mary's feet and Drew him out of the suddenly widening crack there was a tearing Creek and the other crack split open and out of it Pippen sprang as if he had been kicked then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip and complete silence fell thank you said the hobbits one after the other Tom Bombadil burst out laughing well my little fellows said he stooping so that he peered into their

          
          05:57:51
          faces you shall come home with me the table is all Laden with yellow cream ADCB and white bread and butter goldber is waiting time enough for questions around the supper table you follow after me as quick quick as you are able with that he picked up his lies and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path Eastward still singing loudly and nonsensically too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits followed after him as fast as they could but that was not fast enough Tom soon disappeared

          
          05:58:27
          in front of them and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud hello up along my little friends up the way they Windle Toms going on ahead candles for to Kindle down West sinks the sun soon you will be groping when the night Shadows Fall then the door will open out of the window paines light will twinkle yellow fear no all they black he Noy Willow fear nther root nor bow Tom goes on before you hey now Mery doll we'll waiting for

          
          05:59:09
          you after that the hobbits heard no more almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them they thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on the Brandy Wine River and the windows of Buckley beginning to gleam with hundreds of Lights great Shadows fell across them Trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path white Mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders out to the very ground at their feet a shadowy

          
          05:59:42
          steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk it became difficult to follow the path and they were very tired their legs seemed leaden strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and Reeds on either side of them and if they looked up to the pale Sky they caught sight of queer nil and nobbly faces that gloomed dark against the Twilight and leared down at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood they began to feel that all this country was Unreal and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream

          
          06:00:16
          that led to no Awakening just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill they noticed that the ground was gently Rising the water began to murmur in the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam Where the River flowed over a short fall then suddenly the trees came to an end and The Mists were Left Behind they stepped out from the forest and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before them the river now small and Swift was leaping merrily down to meet them glinting here and there in the

          
          06:00:49
          light of the Stars which were already shining in the sky the grass under their feet was smooth and short as if it had been moan or shaven the EES of the forest behind were clipped and trim as a hedge the path was now plain before them well tent Ed and bordered with stone it wound up onto the top of a grassy null now gray under the pale starry night and there still high above them on a further slope they saw the twinkling lights of a house down again the path went and then up again up a long smooth Hillside of turf

          
          06:01:25
          towards the light suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened there was Tom bombadil's house before them up down down Underhill behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay gray and bare and beyond that the dark shapes of the Barrow Downs stalked away into the Eastern night they all hurried forward Hobbits and ponies already half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from them hey come Mery doll rolled out the song to greet them hey come da doll hop along my

          
          06:02:04
          heart h ponies all we are fun the parties now let the fun begin let us sing together then another clear voice as young and as ancient a spring like the song of glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the Hills came falling like silver to meet them now let the song begin let us sing together of sun stars moon and Mist rain and cloudy weather light on the Bing Leaf Dew on the feather wind on the open Hill bells on the hether reads by the Shady pool lies on the water old Tom

          
          06:02:56
          bomil and the river daugh and with that song The Hobbit stood upon the threshold and Golden Light was all about them chapter 7 in the house of Tom Bombadil the four Hobbits stepped over the wide Stone threshold and Stood Still blinking they were in a long low room filled with a light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles tall and yellow burning brightly in a chair at the far side of the room facing the outer door sat a woman her long yellow hair rippled down

          
          06:03:45
          her shoulders her gown was green green as young Reeds shot with silver like beads of Dew and her belt was of gold shaped like a chain of flag lies set with the pale blue eyes of forget Min Nots about her feet in wide vessels of green and brown earn wear white water lies were Flo floating so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool enter good guests she said and as she spoke they knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing they came a few timid steps further into the room and began to Bow

          
          06:04:23
          Low feeling strangely surprised and awkward like folk That Knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of water have been answered by a fair young elf queen clad in living flowers but before they could say anything she sprang lightly up and over the Lily bows and ran laughing towards them and as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river come dear folk she said taking froa by the hand laugh and be merry I'm goldberry daughter of the river then lightly she passed them and closing the

          
          06:05:02
          door she turned her back to it with her white arm spread out across it let us shut out the night she said for you are still afraid perhaps of mist and tree shadows and deep water and untame things fear nothing for tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil the hobbits looked at her in Wonder and she looked at each of them and smiled fair lady goldberry said Frodo at last feeling his heart molded with a joy that he did not understand he stood as he had at times stood Enchanted by Fair Elven voices but the

          
          06:05:41
          spell that was now laid upon him was different less keen and lofty was the Delight but deeper and nearer to Mortal heart marvelous and yet not strange Fair Lady Goldy he said again now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me oh slender as a willow wand oh clearer than clear water oh feed by the living pool Fair River daughter oh Springtime and summertime and spring again after oh wind on the waterfall and the leaves laughter suddenly he stopped and stammered overcome with surprise to hear

          
          06:06:21
          himself saying such things but goldberry laughed welcome she said I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so sweet tonged but I see you are an elf friend the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it this is a merry meeting sit now and wait for the Master of the House he will not be long he's tending your tired beasts The Hobbit sat down gladly in low Rush seated chairs while gbury busied herself about the table and their eyes followed her for the Slender Grace of her movement filled them with quiet

          
          06:06:57
          Delight from somewhere behind of the house came the sound of singing every now and again they caught among many a da doll and a merry doll and a ringering dillow the repeated words old Tom bumil is a merry fellow bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow fair lady said Frodo again after a while tell me if my asking does not seem foolish who is Tom Bombadil he is said goldb staying her Swift movements and smiling Frodo looked at her questioningly he is as you have seen him she said in answer to his look

          
          06:07:42
          he is the master of wood water and Hill then all this strange land belongs to him no indeed she answered and her smile faded that would indeed be a burden she added in a low voice as if to herself the trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves Tom Bombadil is the master no one has ever caught old Tom walking in the forest waiting in the water leaping on the hilltops under light and Shadow he has no fear Tom Bombadil is Master a door opened and in

          
          06:08:20
          came Tom Bombadil he had now no hat and his thick brown hair was crowned with Autumn Leaves he laughed and going to Goldy took a hand here's my pretty lady he said bowing to the hobbits here's my my goldb clothed all in silver green with flowers in her girdle is the table Laden I see yellow cream and ancom and white bread and butter milk cheese and green herbs and R berries gathered is that enough for us is the supper ready it is said goldber but the guests perhaps are not Tom clapped his hands

          
          06:08:59
          and cried Tom Tom your guests are tired and you had near forgotten come now my M friends and Tom will refresh you you shall Clean groy Hands and wash your weary faces cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out your Tangles he opened the door and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn they came to a low room with a sloping roof a penthouse it seemed built onto the North End of the house its walls were of clean Stone but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yellow

          
          06:09:34
          curtains the floor was flagged and strewn with fresh green rushes there were four deep mattresses each piled with white blankets laid on the floor along one side against the opposite wall was a long bench Laden with wide earthware basins and beside it stood Brown ures filled with water some cold some steaming hot there were soft green slippers set ready beside each bed before long washed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at the table two on each side while at either end sat goldb the master it was a long and merry meal

          
          06:10:14
          though the hobbits ate as only famished Hobbits can eat there was no lack the drink in their drinking bowls seemed to be clear cold water yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily as if it was easier and more natural than talking at last Tom and goldb Rose and cleared the table swiftly the guests were commanded to sit quiet and were set in chairs each with a foot stol to his tired feet there was a fire in the wide

          
          06:10:49
          Hearth before them and it was burning with a sweet smell as if it were built of Applewood when everything was set in order all the lights in the room were put out except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the chimney shelf then goldberry came and stood before them holding a candle and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep have peace now she said until the morning heed no nightly noises for nothing passes Door and Window here save Moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hilltop good night she passed out of

          
          06:11:27
          the room with a glimmer and a rustle the sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones and the quiet of night Tom sat on a while beside them in silence while each of them tried to must the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper sleep gathered on their eyelids at last Frodo spoke did you hear me calling master or was it just chance that brought you at that moment Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream what said he did I hear you

          
          06:12:05
          calling nay I did not hear I was busy singing Just chance brought me then if chance you call it it was no plan of mine though I was waiting for you we heard news of you and learned that you were wondering we guessed you'd come air long down to the water all paths lead that way down to withywindle Old gry Willow man he's a mighty singer and it's hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes but Tom had an errand there that he dared not hinder Tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again but he went

          
          06:12:42
          on in a soft singing voice I had an erand there Gathering water lies green leaves and lies white to please my pretty lady the last air the years and to keep them from the winter to Flower by your pretty feet till the Snows are melted each here at Summer's then I go to find them for her in a white pool deep and clear far down with the Windle there they open first in Spring and there they linger latest by that pool long ago I found the river daughter Fair young goldber sitting in the brushes sweet was her singing then and her heart

          
          06:13:29
          was [Music] beating he opened his eyes and looked at them with a glint of blue and that proved well for you for now I shall no longer go down deep again along the forest water not while the year is old nor shall I be passing Old Man Willow's house this side of Springtime not till the merry spring when the river daughter dances down the withy path to bathe in the water [Music] he fell silent again but Frodo could not help asking one more question the one he most desired to have answered tell us Master he said about

          
          06:14:19
          the willow man what is he I've never heard of him before no don't said Mary and Pippen together sitting suddenly upright not now not until the morning that is right said the old man now is the time for resting some things are ill to hear when the world's in Shadow sleep till the morning light rest on the pillow heed no nightly noise fear no gray Willow and with that he took down the lamp and blew it out and grasping a candle in either hand he led them out of the room their mattresses and pillows were

          soft as down and the blankets were of white wool they had hardly laid themselves on the Deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep in the dead night Frodo lay in a dream without light then he saw the young Moon Rising under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock pierced by a dark Arch like a great gate it seemed to Frodo that he was lifted up and passing over he saw that the rock wall was a circle of hills and that within it was a Plaine and in the

          
          06:15:32
          midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone like a vast Tower but not made by hands on its top stood the figure of a man the moon as it Rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it up from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices and the howling of many wolves suddenly a shadow like the shape of great Wings passed across the moon the figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he wielded a a mighty eagle swept

          
          06:16:06
          down and bore him away the voices wailed and the Wolves yammered there was a noise like a strong wind blowing and on it was borne the sound of hes Galloping Galloping Galloping from the East Black Riders thought Frodo as he wakened with the sound of the Hooves still echoing in his mind he wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls he lay motionless still listening but all was now silent and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other

          
          06:16:40
          unremembered dream at his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned suddenly he woke or thought he had wed and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had Disturbed his dream tip-tap squeak the noise was like branches fretting in the wind twig fingers scraping wall and window creek creek Creek he wondered if there were willow trees close to the house and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all

          
          06:17:14
          but inside the Willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again he sat up and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands and he lay down again relieved he seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears fear nothing have peace until the morning heed no nightly noises then he went to sleep again it was the sound of water that Mary heard falling into his quiet sleep water streaming down gently and then spreading spreading irresistibly all around the house into a dark shoreless

          
          06:17:51
          pool it gurgled under the walls and was Rising slowly but surely I shall be drowned he thought it will find its way in and then I shall drown he felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog and and springing up he set his foot on the corner of a cold hard flagstone then he remembered where he was and laid down again he seemed to hear or remember hearing nothing passes doors or Windows save Moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hilltop a little breath of Sweet Air moved the curtain he breathed deep and

          
          06:18:28
          fell asleep again as far as he could remember Sam slept through the night in deep content if logs are contented they woke up all four at once in the Morning Light Tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling when he heard them stir he clapped his hands and cried hey come Mar doll Dey doll myar is he drew back the yellow curtains and The Hobbit saw that these had covered the windows at either end of the room one looking East and the other looking West they leapt up refreshed Frodo ran to the Eastern window and

          
          06:19:09
          found himself looking into a kitchen garden Gray with Dew he had half expected to see Turf right up to the walls Turf all pocked with hoofprints actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles but above and far beyond them the gray top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise it was a pale morning in the East behind long clouds like line of soiled walls stained red at the edges lay glimmering deeps of yellow the sky spoke of rain to come but the light was broadening quickly and the red flowers

          
          06:19:45
          on the beans began to Glow against the wet green leaves Pippin looked out of the western window down into a pool of mist the forest was hidden under a fog it was like looking down onto a sloping Cloud roof from above there was a fold or Channel where the Mist was broken into many plumes and Billows the Valley of the withywindle the stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the White Shadows near at hand was a flower garden and a clipped hedge silver netted and beyond that gray shaven grass pale with Jew

          
          06:20:23
          drops there was no Willow Tree to be seen good morning Merry friends cried Tom opening the Eastern window wide a cool air flowed in it had a rainy smell sun won't show her face much today I'm thinking I have been walking wide leaping on the hilltops since the gray Dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass underfoot wet sky above me I wakened gbury singing Under window but not wakes Hobbit folk in the early morning in the night little folk wake up in the darkness and sleep after light has come ring aing Dow wake now my merry

          
          06:21:05
          friends forget the nightly noises ring a ding Dell derell my hearties if you come soon you'd find breakfast on the table if you come late you'll get grass and rainwater needless to say not that Tom's threat sounded very serious the hobbits came soon and left the table late and only when it was beginning to look rather empty neither Tom nor goldb were there Tom could be heard about the house scattering in the kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and there outside the room looked Westward

          
          06:21:41
          over the Mist clouded Valley and the window was open water dripped down from the thatched eaves above before they had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof and a straight gray rain came softly and steadily down behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled as they looked out of the window they came for falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain out of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up above them they could hear few words but it seemed plain to them that the song

          
          06:22:17
          was a rain song as sweet as showers on dry Hills that told the tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below the hobbits listened with delight and Frodo was glad in his heart and blessed the kindly weather because it delayed them from departing the thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they would not go further that day the upper wind settled in the west and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to spill their Laden rain on the bare

          
          06:22:51
          heads of the Downs nothing could be seen all around the house but Falling Water Frodo stood near the open door and watch the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the the valley Tom Bombadil came trotting around the corner of the house waving his arms as if he were warding off the rain and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry except for his boots these he took off and put into the Chimney Corner then he sat in the largest chair and called the Hobbits to

          
          06:23:24
          gather around him this is gold Berry's washing day he said and her Autumn cleaning too wet for Hobbit folk let them rest while they are able it's a good day for long tales for questions and for answers so Tom will start the talking he told them many remarkable stories sometimes half as if speaking to himself sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his deep brows often his voice would turn to song and he would get out of his chair and dance about he told them Tales of bees and flowers the ways

          
          06:24:02
          of trees and the strange creatures of the forest about the evil things and good things things friendly and things unfriendly cruel things and kind things and secrets hidden under brambles as they listened they began to understand the lives of the forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were at home moving constantly in and out of his talk was old man Willow and Frodo learned now enough to content him indeed more than enough for it was not comfortable

          
          06:24:37
          law Tom's words laid bare the hearts of trees on their thoughts which were often dark and strange and filled with the hatred of things that go free upon the Earth knowing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and usurpers it was not called The Old Forest without reason for it was indeed ancient a survivor of vast forgotten woods and in it there lived yet aging no quicker than the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembering times when they were Lords the countless years had filled them with pride and rooted

          
          06:25:16
          wisdom and with malice but none were more dangerous than the great willow his heart was rotten but his strength was green and he was cunning and a master of winds and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river his gray thirsty spirit power out of the earth and spread like fine root threads in the ground and invisible twig fingers in the air till it had under its Dominion nearly all the trees of the forest from the Hedge to the Downs suddenly Tom's talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream

          
          06:25:54
          over bubbling waterfalls over Pebbles and worn rocks and among small flowers in close grass and wet crannies wandering at last up onto the downs they heard of the great barrows and the green mounds and the stone rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills sheep were bleeding in flocks green Walls and White Walls Rose there were fortresses on the heights Kings of little kingdoms fought together and the young son Shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords there was Victory and defeat and Towers

          
          06:26:32
          fell fortresses were burned and Flames went up into the sky gold was piled on the beers of dead kings and queens and mounds covered them and the stone doors were shut and the grass grew over all sheep walked for a while biting the grass but soon the hills were empty again a shadow came out of Dark Places far away and the bones were stirred in the Mounds Barrow whites walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the wind stone rings grinned out of the ground

          
          06:27:09
          like broken teeth in the Moonlight The Hobbit shuddered even in the Sha the rumor of the barow whites of the barow Downs Beyond the Forest had been heard but it was not a tale that any Hobbit liked to listen to even by a comfortable Fireside far away these four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds that the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded Hills they lost the thread of his tail and shifted uneasily looking aside at one

          
          06:27:44
          another when they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought into times when the world was wider and the Seas flowed straight to the western shore and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient Starlight when only the elf SARS were awake then suddenly he stopped and they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep The Hobbit sat still before him and chanted and it seemed as if under the spell of his words the wind

          
          06:28:21
          had gone and the clouds had dried up and the day had been withdrawn and a Darkness had come from east and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed Frodo could not tell he did not feel either hungry or tired only filled with wonder the Stars Shone through the window and the Silence of the heavens seemed to be around him he spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence who are you master he

          
          06:29:01
          asked what said Tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the Gloom don't you know my name yet that's the only answer tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless but you are young and I am old eldest that's what I am mark my words my friends Tom was here before the river and the trees Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first Acorn he made paths before the big people and saw the little people arriving he was here here before the Kings and the graves and the barow whites when the elves passed

          
          06:29:39
          Westward Tom was here already before the Seas were bent he knew the dark Under the Stars when it was Fearless before the Dark Lord came from outside a shadow seemed to pass by the window and The Hobbit glanced hastily through the panes when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light she held a candle shielding its flame from the draft with her hand and the light flowed through it like sunlight through a white shell the rain has ended she said and new waters are running downhill Under

          
          06:30:18
          the Stars let us now laugh and be glad and let us have food and drink cried Tom long tails are thirsty and long listenings hungry work morning noon and evening with that that he jumped out of his chair and with a bound took a candle from the chimney shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldy held then he danced about the table suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared quickly he returned bearing a large and Laden tray then Tom and goldberry set the table and The Hobbit sat half in Wonder and half in laughter

          
          06:30:57
          so fair was the grace of goldb and so Merry and odd the capering of Tom yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance neither hindering the other in and out of the room and round about the table and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order the boards blazed with candles white and yellow Tom bowed to his guests supper is ready said goldb and now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle and her shoes were like Fisher mail but Tom was all in clean

          
          06:31:34
          blue blue as rainwashed forget me knuts and he had green stockings it was a supper even better than before the hobbits under the spell of Tom's words may have missed one meal or many but when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten they did not sing or even speak much for a while and paid close attention to business but after a time their hearts and Spirits Rose High again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them songs that

          
          06:32:13
          began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and Waters wider than any they had known and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the Fireside but Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions he appeared already to know much about them and all their families and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Sha down from

          
          06:32:48
          Days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves it no longer surprised them for he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to Farmer maggot whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had imagined there's Earth under his old feet and Clay on his fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes are open said Tom it was also clear that Tom had dealings with the elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had reached him from gildor concerning the flight of

          
          06:33:22
          Frodo indeed so much did Tom know and so cunning was his questioning that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before for even to Gandalf Tom wagged his head up and down and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders show me the precious ring he said suddenly in the midst of the story and Frodo to his own astonishment Drew Out The Chain from his pocket and unfastening the ring handed it at once to Tom it seemed to grow larger as it lay

          
          06:33:57
          for a moment on his big brown skinned hand then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed for for a second the hobbits had a vision both comical and alarming of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold then Tom put the ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candl light for a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this then they gasped there was no sign of Tom Bombadil disappearing Tom laughed again and then he spun the ring in the air and it vanished with a flash threr gave a cry

          
          06:34:34
          and Tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile Frodo looked at it closely and rather suspiciously like one who has lent a trinklet to a juggler it was the same ring or looked the same and weighed the same for that ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand but something prompted him to make sure he was perhaps a trial annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important he waited for an opportunity when the talk was going again and Tom

          
          06:35:10
          was telling an absurd story about Badges and their queer ways then he slipped the ring on Mary turned towards him to say something and gave a start and checked an exclamation Frodo was delighted in a way it was his own ring all right for medy was staring blankly at his chair and obviously couldn't see him he got up and crept quiet ly Away From The Far Side toward the outer door hey there cried Tom glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shining eyes hey come Frodo there where be you a going old Tom bombadil's

          
          06:35:48
          not as blind as that yet take off your golden ring your hands more fair without it come back leave your game and sit down beside me we must talk a while more and think about the morning Tom must teach the right Road and keep your feet from wandering Frodo laughed trying to feel pleased and taking off the ring he came and sat down again Tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would shine tomorrow and that it would be a glad morning and setting out would be hopeful but they would do well to start early

          
          06:36:24
          for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket I am no Weather Master he said nor is ought that goes on two legs by his advice they decided to make nearly due north from his house over the Western and lower slopes of the Downs they might hope in that way to strike the East Road in a Day's Journey and avoid the barrows he told them not to be afraid but to mind their own business keep to the

          
          06:36:57
          green grass don't you go a meddling with Old Stone or cold whites or prying in their houses unless you you be strong folk with hearts that never falter he said this more than once and he advised them to pass barrows by on the west side if they chance to stray near one then he taught them a rhyme to sing if they should by ill luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day Tom Tom by water wood and hill by the Reed and Willow by fire Sun and moon H now and hear us come for our need is near us when they had sung this song all

          
          06:37:46
          together after him he clapped them each on the shoulder with a laugh and taking candles LED them back to their bedroom chapter 8 fog on the bow Downs that night they heard no noises but either in his dreams or out of them he could not tell which Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a gray rain curtain and growing stronger to turn the veil all to Glass and silver until at last it was rolled back and a far Green Country opened before him under a swift

          
          06:38:27
          Sunrise the vision melted into waking and there was Tom whistling like a tree full of birds and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window outside everything was green and pale gold after breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning cool bright and clean under a washed Autumn Sky of Thin Blue the air came fresh from the Northwest their quiet Ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly Tom came out of

          
          06:39:07
          the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep bidding the Hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed they rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house and went slanting up towards the North End Of The Hill brow under which it sheltered they had just dismounted to leave their ponies up the last steep slope when suddenly Frodo stopped goldberry he cried My Fair Lady clad all in silver green we have never said farewell to her nor seen her since the evening he was so distressed that he

          
          06:39:44
          turned back but at that moment a clear call came Rippling down there on the hillbrow she stood beckoning to them her hair was flying loose and as it caught the sun it Shone and shimmered a light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she danced they hastened up the last slope and stood breathless beside her they bowed but with a wave of her arm she B them look round and they looked out from the hilltops over lands under the Misty morning it was now as clear and far seen

          
          06:40:21
          as it had been veiled and Misty when they stood upon the null in the forest which could now be seen Rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the West in that direction the land Rose in wooded ridges green yellow russet Under the Sun Beyond which lay hidden the Valley of the Brandy Wine to the south over the line of the withy Windle there was a distant glint like pale glass where the Brandy Wine River made a Great Loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits northward beyond the dwindling Downs the

          
          06:40:58
          land ran away in flats and swellings of gray and green and pale Earth colors until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distance Eastward the batt Downs Rose Ridge behind Ridge into the morning and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the Hem of the sky but it spoke to them out of memory and old tales of the high and distant mountains they took a deep draft of the air and felt that a skip and a few Stout strides would bear them whatever they

          
          06:41:34
          wished it seemed faint-hearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the DS toward the road when they should be leaping as Lusty as Tom over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the mountains goldb spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts speed now Fair guests she said and hold to your purpose North with a wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps make haste while the sun shines and to Frodo she said farewell elf friend it was a merry meeting but Frodo found no words to

          
          06:42:16
          answer he bowed low and mounted his Pony and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill Tom bombadil's house and the valley and the forest were lost to view the air grew warmer between the Green walls of Hillside and Hillside and the scent of turf Rose strong and sweet as they breathed turning back when they reached the bottom of the green Hollow they saw goldb now small and slender like a sunlet flood against the sky she was standing still watching them and her

          
          06:42:52
          hands were stretched out towards them as they looked she gave a clear call and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill their way wound along the floor of the hollow and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader Valley and then over the shoulder of further Hills and down their long Limbs and up their smooth sides again up onto new hilltops and down into new valleys there was no tree nor any visible water it was a country of grass and short springy Turf silent except for

          
          06:43:31
          the whisper of the air over the edges of the the land and high lonely cries of strange birds as they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less when they caught a glimpse of the country Westward the distant Forest seemed to be smoking as if the fall and rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mold a shadow now lay around the edge of sight a dark Haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap hot and heavy about midday they came to a hill whose

          
          06:44:07
          top was wide and flattened like a shallow sorcer with a green mounded Rim inside there was no air stirring and the sky seemed near their heads they rode across and looked northwards then their hearts Rose for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive but there could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end a Long Valley lay below them winding away northwards until it came to an opening between two steep

          
          06:44:41
          shoulders Beyond there seemed to be no more Hills due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line that is a line of trees said Mary and that must Mark the road all along it for many leagues east of the bridge there are trees growing some say they were planted in the old days splendid said Frodo if we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning we shall have left the Downs before the sunsets and be jogging on in search of a camping place but even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards and he saw that on that

          
          06:45:19
          side the hills were higher and looked down upon them and all those Hills were crowned with Green Mountains and on some were standing stones pointing upwards like Jagged teeth out of green gums that view was somehow disquieting so they turned from the site and went down into the Hollow Circle in the midst of it there stood a single Stone Standing Tall under the sun above and at this hour casting no Shadow it was shapeless and yet significant like a landmark or a guarding finger or more like a warning

          
          06:45:55
          but they were now hungry and the sun was still at the Fearless noon so they set their backs against the east side of the stone it was cool cool as if the sun had had no power to warm it but at that time this seemed Pleasant there they took food and drink and made as good a noon meal under the Open Sky as anyone could wish for the food came from down Underhill Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day the ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass riding over the hills and eating

          
          06:46:30
          their fill the warm sun and the scent of Turf lying a little too long stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses these things are perhaps enough to explain what happened however that may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take the standing Stone was cold and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched Eastward over them the Sun a pale and watery yellow was gleaming ing through the Mist just above the West Wall of the hollow in which they lay north south and east

          
          06:47:09
          Beyond the Wall the fog was thick cold and white the air was silent heavy and chill their Ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the Western Rim they found that they were upon an island in the fog even as they looked out in dismay towards the Setting Sun it sank before Before Their Eyes into a white sea and a cold gray Shadow sprang up in the East behind the fog rolled up to the walls and Rose above them and as it mounted it bent over their heads until

          
          06:47:45
          it became a roof they were shut in a hall of mist whose Central pillar was a standing Stone they felt as if a trap was closing about them but they did not quite lose heart they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the road ahead and they still knew in which direction it lay in any case they now had so great a dislike for that Hollow Place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in their minds they packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work soon they were leading their ponies

          
          06:48:21
          in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the Hill down into a foggy sea as they went down the Mist became colder and damper and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads when they reached the bottom it was so cold that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods which soon became bedewed with gray drops then mounting their ponies they went slowly on again feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground they were steering as well as they could guess for the gate likee

          
          06:48:56
          opening at the far northward end of the Long Valley which they had seen in the morning once they were through the gap they had only to keep on in anything like a straight line and they were Bound in the end to strike the road their thoughts did not go beyond that except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs there might be no fog their going was very slow to prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions they went in file with Frodo leading Sam was behind him

          
          06:49:31
          and after him came in and then Mery the valley seemed to stretch on endlessly suddenly froa saw a hopeful sign on either side ahead a Darkness began to loom through the mist and he guessed that they were at last approaching the Gap in the Hills the north gate of the barow Downs if they could pass that they would be free come on follow me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried forward but his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm the dark patches grew darker but they shrank and suddenly he saw towering

          
          06:50:09
          ominous before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door two huge Standing Stones he could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning he had passed between them almost before he was aware and even as he did so Darkness seemed to fall round him his Pony reared and snorted and he fell off off when he looked back he found that he was alone the others had not followed him Sam he called Pippin Mary come along

          
          06:50:42
          why don't you keep up there was no answer fear took him and he ran back past the stone shouting wildly Sam Sam Mary Pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished from someway off or so it seemed he thought he heard a cry ho Frodo ho it was away Eastward on his left as he stood under the great Stones staring and straining into the Gloom he plunged off into the direction of the call and found himself going steeply uphill as he struggled on he called again and kept on calling more and more frantically but he heard no answer for

          
          06:51:23
          some time and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above him Frodo Hoy came the thin voices out of the Mist and then a cry that sounded like help help often repeated ending with a last help that trailed off into a long whale suddenly cut short he stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries but the light was now gone and clinging night had closed about him so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up only the change in the level of the

          
          06:52:02
          ground At His Feet told him when he at last came to the top of a ridge or Hill he was weary sweating and yet chilled it was holy dark where are you he cried out miserably there was no reply he stood listening he was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind a change was coming in the weather the Mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters his breath was smoking and the Darkness was Less near and thick he looked up and saw with surprise that

          
          06:52:43
          faint stars were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog the wind began to hiss over the grass he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and he made towards it and even as he went forward the Mist was rolled up and thrust aside and the Starry Sky was UN veiled a glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round Hilltop which he must have climbed from the north out of the East the biting wind was blowing to his right there loomed against the westward

          
          06:53:17
          Stars a dark black shape a great Barrow stood there where are you he cried again both angry and Afraid here said a voice deep and cold that seemed to come out of the ground I I am waiting for you no said Frodo but he didn't run away his knees gave and he fell on the ground nothing happened and there was no sound trembling he looked up in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the Stars it leaned over him he thought there were two eyes very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come

          
          06:53:59
          from some remote distance then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him the icy Touch froze his bones and he remembered no more when he came to himself again for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dread then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly he was in a barow a barrow White had taken him and he was probably already under the Dreadful spells of the bow whites a about which whispered Tales spoke he dared not move but lay as he found himself flat on his back Upon A

          
          06:54:40
          Cold Stone with his hands on his breast but though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was around him he found himself as he lay thinking about billbo Baggins and his stories of their jogging along together in the lanes of the Sha and talking about roads and Adventures there is a seed of Courage hidden often deeply it is true in the heart of the fattest and most timid Hobbit waiting for some final and desperate danger to make it grow Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid

          
          06:55:16
          indeed though he did not know it Bilbo and Gandalf had thought him the best Hobbit in the sh he thought he'd come to the end of his adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him he found himself stiffening as if for a final spring he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey as he lay there thinking and getting a hold of himself he noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing around him it did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in for the light

          
          06:55:53
          seemed to be coming out of himself and from the floor beside him and had not yet reached the roof or wall he turned and there in the old glow he saw lying beside him Sam Pippen and Mary they were on their backs and their faces looked deathly pale and they were clad in white about them lay many Treasures of gold maybe though in that light they looked cold and unlovely on their heads were circlets gold chains were about their waists and on their fingers were many rings swords lay by their sides and

          
          06:56:30
          shields were at their feet but across cross their three necks lay one long naked sword suddenly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling The Voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary sometimes high in the air and thin sometimes like a low moan from the ground out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds strings of words would now and again shaped themselves Grim hard cold words heartless and miserable the night was railing against the morning of which it was bereaved and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it

          
          06:57:09
          hungered froda was chilled to the meow after a while the song became clearer and with Dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation cold be hand and heart and Bone and cold be sleep under Stone never more to wake on Stony bed never till the sun fails and the Moon is dead in the Black Wind the Stars shall die and still on gold here let them lie till the dark lord lifts his hand over Dead Sea and withered land he heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound raising himself on

          
          06:57:56
          one arm he looked and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner around the corner a long arm was grouping walking on its fingers toward Sam who was lying nearest and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him at first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation then a wild thought of Escape came to him he wondered if he put on the ring whether the barow white would miss him and he might find some way out he thought of himself running

          
          06:58:32
          free over the grass grieving for Mary and Sam and Pippen but free and Alive himself Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do but the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong he could not leave his friend so easily he wavered groping in his pocket and then fought with himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearer suddenly resolve hardened in him and he seized a short sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions with what strength he had he

          
          06:59:10
          hewed at The Crawling arm near the wrist and the Hand broke off but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt there was a shriek and the light vanished in the dark there was a snarling noise Frodo fell forward over Mary and Mary's face felt cold all at once back into his mind from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came the memory of the house down under the hill and of Tom singing he remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them in a small desperate voice he began

          
          06:59:44
          ho Tom Bombadil and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong it had a full and Lively sound and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet oh Tom bomil Tom bom Badillo by water wood and hill by the Reed and Willow by fire sun and moon haen now and hear us come Tom bomil for our need is near us there was a sudden deep silence in which Frodo could hear his heart beating after a long slow moment he heard plain but far away as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls an answering voice

          
          07:00:33
          singing oh Tom padil is a merry fellow bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow none has ever caught him yet for Tommy is the master his songs are strong as songs and he feet the faster there was a loud rumbling sound as of stones rolling and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day a low door-like opening of appeared at the end of the chamber Beyond Frodo's feet and there was Tom's head hat feather and all framed against the light of the sun rising red behind

          
          07:01:12
          him the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces of the three Hobbits lying beside Frodo they didn't stir but the sickly Hue had left them they looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep Tom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark chamber singing get out you old white vanish in the sunlight shriv like the cold Mist like the winds go wailing out into the baren lands far beyond the mountains come never here again leave your Barrow empty lust and forgotten be darker than the darkness

          
          07:01:55
          where Gates stand forever shut till the world is mened at these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash then there was a long trailing shriek fading away into an unguessable distance and after that silence come friend Frodo said Tom let us get out on to clean grass you must help me bear them together They carried out Mary Pippen and Sam as Frodo left the barow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a wounded spider in a heap of Fallen Earth Tom went back in

          
          07:02:41
          again and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping when he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper and bronze many beads and chains and jeweled ornaments he climbed the green Barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine there he stood with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair and looked down upon the three Hobbits that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound raising his right hand he said in a clear and

          
          07:03:16
          commanding Voice Wake now my Merry Lads wake and hear me calling warm now be heart and limb the Cold Stone is Fallen Dark Door is standing wide Dead Hand is broken night and the night is flown and the gate is open to Frodo's great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms rubbed their eyes and then suddenly sprang up they looked about in amazement first at Frodo and then at Tom standing large as life on the barow top above them and then at themselves in their thin white Rags crowned and belted with pale gold

          
          07:03:59
          and jingling with trinkets what in the name of Wonder began Mary feeling the golden ciret that had slipped over one eye then he stopped and a shadow came over his face and he closed his eyes of course I remember he said the men of caroom came on us at night and we were worsted ah the spear in my heart he clutched at his breast no no he said opening his eyes what am I saying I've been scaming where did you get to Frodo I thought that I was lost said Frodo but I don't want to speak of it let us think of what we to do now let us

          
          07:04:43
          go on dressed up like this sir said Sam where are my clothes he flung his circlet belt and rings on the grass and looked around helplessly as if he expected to find his cloak jacket and britches and other Hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand you won't find your clothes again said Tom bounding down from the mound and laughing as he danced around them in the sunlight one would have thought that nothing dangerous or Dreadful had happened and indeed The hter Faded out of their hearts as they looked at him

          
          07:05:18
          and saw the medy glint in his eyes what do you mean asked Pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amused why not but Tom shook his head saying you found yourselves again then out of the deep water clothes are but little loss if you escape from drowning be glad my Merry friends and let the warm sunlight heat now heart and limb cast off these cold rags run naked on the grass while Tom goes a hunting he sprang away downhill whistling and calling looking down after him froo saw him running away southwards

          
          07:05:55
          Along the green Hollow between their Hill and the next still whistling and crying hey now come ho now with do you wonder up down near or far here there or Y sharp ears wise nose swish tail and bkin white socks my little lad and old faty Lumpkin so he sang running fast tossing up his hat and catching it until he was hidden by a fold of the ground but for some time his hey now ho now came floating ing back down the wind which had shifted round towards the South the air was growing very warm again the hobbits ran about for a while

          
          07:06:42
          on the grass as he told them then they lay basking in the sun with the Delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly climb or of people that after being long ill and bedridden wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is Again full of Promise by the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies their own five and one more the last was plainly old

          
          07:07:22
          fatty Lumpkin he was larger stronger fatter and older than their own ponies Mary took to whom the others belonged had not in fact given them any such names but they answered to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest of their lives Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and stood in a line then Tom bowed to the hobbits here are your ponies now he said theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering Hobbits have more sense in their noses for they sniff danger ahead

          
          07:08:00
          which you walk right into and if they run to save themselves then they run the right way you must forgive them all for though their hearts of faithful to face fear of barow whites is not what they were made for see here they come again bring all their burdens Mary Sam and Pippen now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs and they soon felt too hot for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the on coming of winter where does that other old animal

          
          07:08:36
          that fatty Lumpkin come from asked rodo he's mine said Tom my four-legged friend though I seldom ride him and he wanders often far free upon the hillsides when your ponies stayed with me they got to know my Lumpkin and they smelt him in the night and quickly ran to meet him I thought he'd look for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away but now my Jolly Lumpkin old Tom's going to ride hey he's coming with you just to set you on the road so he needs a pony for you cannot easily

          
          07:09:16
          talk to Hobbits that are riding when you're on your own legs trying to trot beside them the hobbits were delighted to hear this and thanked Tom many times but he laughed and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land I've got things to do he said my making and my singing my talking and my walking and my watching of the country Tom can't be always near to open doors and Willow cracks Tom has his house to mind and goldberry is

          
          07:09:54
          waiting it was still fairly early by the sun something between 9 and 10 and the hobbits turned their minds to food their last meal had been lunch beside the standing Stone the day before they breakfasted now off the remainder of Tom's Provisions meant for their supper with additions that Tom had brought with him it was not a large meal considering Hobbits and the circumstances but they felt much better for it while they were eating Tom went up to the mound and looked through the treasures most of these he made into a

          
          07:10:29
          pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass he B them lie there free to all finders Birds beasts elves or men and all kindly creatures for so the spell of the mound should be broken and Scattered and no white ever come back to it he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones many shaded like flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflies he looked long at it as if stirred by some memory Shak shaking his head and saying at last here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady fair was she who long ago

          
          07:11:10
          wore this on her shoulder goldb shall wear it now and we will not forget her for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger long leaf-shaped and Keen of marvelous workmanship damis with serpent forms in red and gold they gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths rought of some strange metal light and strong and set with many fiery Stones whether by some virtue in these sheathes or because of the spell that lay on the mound the blade seemed Untouched by time unrusted sharp glittering in the sun old

          
          07:11:49
          knives are long enough as swords for Hobbit people he said sharp blades are good to have if sh folk go walking east south or far away into dark and danger then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago by men of westernness they were foes of the Dark Lord but they were overcome by the evil king of kandum in the land of Angar few now remember them Tom murmured yet still some go wandering sons of Forgotten Kings walking in loneliness guarding from Evil things folk that are heedless the hobbits did not understand

          
          07:12:31
          his words but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them like a vast shadowy plain over which there stro shapes of men tall and Grim with bright swords and last came one with a star on his brow then the vision faded and they were back in the sunlet world it was time to start again they were ready packing their bags and lading their ponies their new weapons they hung on their leather belt under their jackets feeling them very awkward and wondering if they would be

          
          07:13:06
          of any use fighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them at last they set off they LED their ponies down the hill and then mounting they trotted quickly along the valley they looked back and saw the top of the old Mound on the hill and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame then they turned the shoulder of the downs and it was hidden from view though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great

          
          07:13:43
          Stone standing like a gate and before long they came to the northern Gap and rode swiftly through and the land fell away before them it was a meded journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gay beside them or before them on fatty Lumpkin who could move much faster than his girth promised Tom sang most of the time but it was chiefly nonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly those of Wonder and Delight they went forward steadily but they soon saw that the road was further

          
          07:14:20
          away than they had imagined even without a fog their sleep at midday would have prevented them from reaching it until after Nightfall on the day before the dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep Dyke with a steep wall on the further side Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom but a very long time ago he seemed to remember something sad about it and wouldn't say much they climbed down and out of the Dyke and threw a gap in the wall and

          
          07:14:56
          then Tom turned due north for they had been bearing somewhat to the West the land was now open and fairly level and they quickened their Pace but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead and they knew that they had come back to the road after many unexpected Adventures they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and halted under the Long Shadows of the trees they were on the top of a sloping bank and the road now dim as evening Drew on wound away below them

          
          07:15:32
          at this point it ran nearly from Southwest to Northeast and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide Hollow it was rotted and bore many signs of the recent Heavy Rain there were pools and potholes full of water they rode down the bank and looked up and down there was nothing to be seen well here we are again at last said Frodo I suppose we haven't lost more than two days by my shortcut through the forest but perhaps the delay will prove useful it may have put them off our Trail the others looked at him the

          
          07:16:09
          shadow of the fear of the Black Riders came suddenly over them again ever since they had entered the forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the road only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them and was more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the road itself they looked anxiously back towards the Setting Sun but the road was brown and empty do you think asked Pippin hesitatingly do you think we may be pursued tonight no I hope not tonight answered

          
          07:16:44
          Tom Bombadil nor perhaps the next day but do not trust my guess for I cannot tell for certain out east my knowledge fails Tom is not master of riders from the black land far beyond his country all the the hobbits wished he was coming with them they felt that he would know how to deal with Black Riders if anyone did they would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them and beyond all but the most vague and distant Legends of the Sha and in the Gathering Twilight they longed for home a deep loneliness and sense of

          
          07:17:22
          loss was on them they stood silent reluctant to make the final parting and only slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell well and telling them to have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting Tom will give you good advice till this day is over after that your own luck must go with you and guide you four miles along the road you'll come upon a village Brie under Brie Hill with doors looking Westward there you'll find an old Inn that is called the prancing pony barley and butterbur is the worthy

          
          07:18:00
          keeper there you can stay the night and afterwards the morning will speed you upon your way be bold but wary keep up your Merry hearts and ride to meet your fortune They begged him to come at least as far as the in and drink once more with him but he laughed and refused saying Tom's Country ends here he will not pass the borders Tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting then he turned tossed up his hat leapt on lumpkin's back and rode up over the bank and Away singing into the dusk the hobbits climbed up and watched

          
          07:18:41
          him until he was out of sight I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil said Sam he's a caution and no mistake I reckon we may go a good deal further and see not better nor queerer but I won't deny I'll be glad to see this prancing pony he spoke of I hope it'll be like the the green drag and a way back home what sort of folk are they in Brie there are Hobbits in Brie said Mary as well as big folk I dare say it'll be homelike enough the pony is a good in by all accounts my people ride out there

          
          07:19:18
          now and again it may be all we could wish said Frodo but it's outside the sh all the same don't make yourselves too much at home please remember all of you that the name of bag and must not be mentioned I am Mr Underhill if any name must be given they now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening Darkness came down quickly as they ploted slowly downhill and up again until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead before them Rose Brie Hill baring the way a dark Mass against Misty stars

          
          07:19:56
          and under its Western flank nestled a large Village towards it they now Ed Desiring only to find a fire and a door between them and the Night chapter nine at the sign of the prancing pony Brie was the chief Village of the Bree land a small inhabited region like an island in the empty lands round about besides Bri itself there was stadle on the other side of the Hill Kum in the a deep valley a little further Eastward and Arch it on the edge of the Chetwood lying round Brie Hill and The Villages was a small country of fields

          
          07:20:40
          and tamed Woodland only a few miles broad the men of Brie were brown haired Broad and rather short cheerful and independent they belonged to nobody but themselves but they were more friendly and familiar with Hobbits dwarves elves and other inhabitants of the world about them than was or is usual with big people according to their own Tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants of the first men that ever wandered into the west of the middle World few had survived the turmoils of the Elder days but when the

          
          07:21:17
          Kings returned again over the great sea they had found the bre men still there and they were still there now when the memory of the Old Kings had faded into the grass in those days no other men had settled dwellings so far west or within 100 leagues of the sh but in the wild Lands Beyond Bri there were mysterious Wanderers the Brie folk called them Rangers and knew nothing of their origin they were taller and darker than the men of Brie and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing and to understand the

          
          07:21:53
          languages of beasts and birds they roamed at will southwards and eastwards even as far as the Misty Mountain but they were now few and rarely seen when they appeared they brought news from afar and told strange Forgotten Tales which were eagerly listened to but the Brie folk did not make friends of them there were also many families of Hobbits in the Bree land and they claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world one that was founded long before even the Brandy Wine was crossed and the Sha

          
          07:22:29
          colonized they lived mostly in stadle though there were some in Bri itself especially on the higher slopes of the Hill above the houses of the men the big folk and the little folk as they called one another were on friendly terms minding their own Affairs in their own ways but both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Brie folk no where else in the world was this peculiar but excellent arrangement to be found the bre folk big and little didn't themselves travel much and the Affairs of the four Villages were their

          
          07:23:07
          Chief concern occasionally the hobbits of Brie went as far as Buckland or the East Farthing but though their little land was not much farther than a days riding east of the Brandy Wine Bridge the hobbits of the Sha now seldom visited it an occasional Buckland or adventurous toque would come out to the Inn for a night or two but even that was becoming less and less usual the Sha Hobbits referred to those of Brie and to any others that lived beyond the borders as Outsiders and took very little interest in them considering

          
          07:23:43
          them dull and uncouth there were probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the west of the world in those days than the people of The Shard imagined some doubtless were no better than tramps ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them but in the bre land at any rate the hobbits were decent and prosperous and no more rustic than most of their distant relatives inside it was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between the Shire

          
          07:24:16
          and Brie there was brie blood in the Brandy Box by all accounts the village of Brie had some hund Stone houses of the big folk mostly above the road nestling on the hillside with wind looking West on that side running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to it there was a deep Dyke with a thick hedge on the inner side over this the road crossed by a Causeway but where it pierced the Hedge it was barred by A Great Gate there was another gate in the southern corner where the road ran out of the village

          
          07:24:52
          the gates were closed at nightfall but just inside them were small lodges for The Gatekeepers down on the road Road where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the Hill there was a large Inn it had been built long ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greater for Bree stood at an old meeting of ways another ancient Road crossed the East road just outside the Dyke at the Western end of the village and in former days men and other folk of various sorts had traveled much on it strange as news from brie was still

          
          07:25:30
          saying in the East Farthing descending from those days when news from north south and east could be heard in the inn and when the sh Hobbits used to go more often to hear it but the northern lands had long been desolate and the North Road was now seldom used it was grass grown and the Brie folk called it the greenway the Inn of Brie was still there however and the inkeeper was an important person his house was a meeting place for the talkative and inquisitive among the inhabitants large and small of the four

          
          07:26:06
          Villages and a resort of Rangers and other Wanderers and for such Travelers mostly dwarves as still journeyed on the East Road to and from the mountains it was dark and white stars were shining when Frodo and his companions came at last to The Greenway Crossing and Drew near the village they came to the west gate and found it shut but at the door of the lodge Beyond it there was a man sitting he jumped up and fetched the Lantern and looked over the gate at them in Surprise what do you want and where do

          
          07:26:44
          you come from he asked gruffly we are making for the in here answered Frodo we are journeying East and cannot go further tonight orbits four Hobbits and what's more out of the sh by their talk said the gatekeeper Softly As if speaking to himself he stared at them Darkly for a moment and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride through we don't often see sh folk riding on the road at night he went on as they halted a moment by his door you'll pardon my wondering what business takes you away Easter Bri what

          
          07:27:19
          may your names be might I ask our names and our business are our own and this doesn't seem a good place to discuss them said Frodo not liking the look of the man or the tone of his voice your business is your own no doubt said the man but it's my business to ask questions after Nightfall we're Hobbits from Buckland and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the in here put in Mary I am Mr brandybuck is that enough for you the Brie folk used to be fair spoken to Travelers or so I had heard all right all right said the man I

          
          07:27:59
          meant no offense but you'll find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you questions there's queer folk about if you go on to the pony you'll find you're not the only guests he wished them good night and they said no more but Frodo could see in the lantern light that the man was still eyeing them curiously he was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them as they rode forward he wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether anyone had been asking for news of a party of

          
          07:28:32
          Hobbits could it have been gandal he might have arrived while they were delayed in the forest and the downs but there was something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy the man stared after the hobbits for a moment and then he went back to his house as soon as his back was turned a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the Shadows of the Village Street the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope passing a few detached houses and Drew up outside the Inn the houses looked

          
          07:29:11
          large and strange to them Sam stared up at the Inn with its three stories and many windows and felt his heart sink he'd imagined himself meeting Giants taller than trees and other creatures even more terrifying sometime or other in the course of his journey but at the moment he was finding his first sight of men and their tall houses quite enough indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the inyard and Black Riders peering out of dark upper

          
          07:29:46
          windows we surely aren't going to stay here for the night are we sir he exclaimed if there are Hobbit folk in these parts why don't we look for some that would be willing to take us in it would be more homelike what's wrong with the Inn said Frodo Tom Bombadil recommended it I expect it's home likee enough inside even from the outside the in looked a pleasant house to Familiar Eyes it had a front on the road and two Wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill so that at

          
          07:30:21
          the rear the second floor windows were level with a ground there was a wide Arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings and on the left under the Arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps the door was open and light streamed out of it above the arch there was a lamp and beneath it swung a large sign board a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs over the door was painted in white letters the prancing pony by barle and butterbur many of the lower Windows showed lights behind thick

          
          07:30:56
          curtains as they hesitated outside in the Gloom someone began singing a med song inside and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus they listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their ponies the song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping they LED their ponies under the arch and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the steps Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face he had a white apron on and was

          
          07:31:31
          bustling out of one door and in through another carrying a tray Laden with full mugs can we began Frodo half a minute if you please shouted the man over his shoulder and vanished into a babble of voices and a cloud of smoke in a moment he was out again wiping his hands on his apron good evening little Master he said bending down what may you be wanting beds for four and stabling for five ponies if that can be managed are you Mr butterbur that's right bman is my name barment butur At Your Service

          
          07:32:12
          you're from the sh e he said and then suddenly he clapped his hand to his forhead as if trying to remember something hbits he cried now what does that remind me of might I ask your name Sir Mr Tuk and Mr bryu said Frodo and this is Sam gamji my name is Underhill there now said Mr butterbur snapping his fingers it's gone again but it'll come back when I've time to think I'm run off my feet but I'll see what I can do for you we don't often get a party out of the sh nowadays and I should be sorry not to make you welcome

          
          07:32:54
          but there such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn't been for long enough it never rained but at pors we say in Bri hi Noob he shouted where are you you woly footed Slow Coach Noob coming sir coming a cheery looking Hobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing the Travelers stopped short and stared at them with great interest where's Bob asked the landlord you don't know well find him double sharp I haven't got six legs nor six eyes neither tell Bob there five ponies that have to be stabled he must

          
          07:33:33
          find room somehow knob trotted off with a grin and a wink well now what was I going to say said Mr butterbur tapping his forehead one thing drives out another so to speak I'm that busy tonight my head is going round there's a party that came up the Green Way from down south last night and that was strange enough to begin with then there's a traveling company of dwarves going West come in this evening and now there's you if you weren't Hobbits I doubt if we could house you but we've got a room more to in the

          
          07:34:09
          north Wing that were made special for Hobbits when this place was built on the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows and all as they like it I hope you'll be comfortable you'll be wanting supper I don't doubt as soon as may be this way now he led them a short way down a passage and opened a door here is a nice little parlor he said I hope it will suit excuse me now I'm that busy no time for talking I must be trotting it's hard work with two legs but I don't get thinner I'll look in again later if you want anything ring

          
          07:34:47
          the handbell and knob will come if he don't come ring and Shout off he went at last and left them feeling rather breathless he seemed capable of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be they found themselves in a small and cozy room there was a bit of bright fire burning on the halfth and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs there was a round table already spread with a white cloth and on it was a large hand bell but knob The Hobbit servant came bustling in long before they

          
          07:35:21
          thought of ringing he brought candles and a trayful of plates will you be wanting anything to drink Masters he asked and shall I show you the bedrooms while your supper is got ready they were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr butar and knob came in again in a twinkling the table was laid there was hot soup cold meats a black Brit tart new loaves SBS of butter and half a ripe cheese good plain food as good as a sh could show and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam's misgivings already

          
          07:35:58
          much relieved by the Excell of the beer the landlord hovered around for a little and then proposed to leave them I don't know whether you would care to join the company when you've SED he said standing at the door perhaps you'd rather go to your beds still the company would be very pleased to welcome you if you had a mind we don't get Outsiders travelers from the sh I should say begging your pardon often and we like to hear a bit of news or any story or song you may have in mind but as you please

          
          07:36:31
          ring the bell if you lack anything so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper about 3/4 of an hour steady going not hindered by unnecessary talk that Frodo Pippen and Sam decided to join the company medy said it would be too stuffy I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air mind your pe's and q's and don't forget that you're supposed to be escaping in secret and I still on the high road and not very far from the Shire all right said Pippen mind

          
          07:37:08
          yourself don't get lost and don't forget that it's safer indoors the company was in the big common room of the Inn the Gathering was large and mixed as froda discovered when his eyes got used to the light this came chiefly from a blazing log fire for the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim and half veiled In Smoke BM and butterbar were standing near the fire talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two Strang looking men on the benches were various folk men of Brie a collection of local Hobbits sitting

          
          07:37:43
          chattering together a few more dwarves and other vague figures difficult to make out in the shadows and Corners as soon as a sh Hobbits entered there was a chorus of Welcome from the bre Landers The Strangers especially those that come up the Green Way stared at them curiously the landlord introduced the newcomers to the Brie folk so quickly that though they caught many names they were seldom sure who the names belonged to the men of Bree seemed all to have rather Botanical and to the shy folk rather odd names like rushlight

          
          07:38:20
          goat Leaf Heather toes appledore thistle wool and Fernie not to mention butterbur some of the hobbits had similar names the mugw PS for instance seemed numerous but most of them had natural names such as Banks Brock House longh holes sandhe and tunn many of which were used in the Sha there were several underhills from stadle and as they could not imagine sharing a name without being related they took Frodo to their hearts as a long lost cousin the Brie Hobbits were in fact friendly and inquisitive and Frodo soon

          
          07:39:00
          found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be given he gave out that he was interested in history and geography at which there was much wagging of heads although neither of these words were much used in the Brie dialect he said he was thinking of writing a book at which there was silent astonishment and that he and his friends wanted to collect information about Hobbits living outside the Sha especially in the Eastern lands at this chorus of voices broke out if Frodo had really wanted to write a

          
          07:39:33
          book and had had many ears he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes and if that was not enough he was given a whole list of names beginning with old barley man here to whom he could go for further information but after a time as Frodo didn't show any sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the Sha Frodo didn't prove very communicative and he soon found himself sitting alone in a corner listening and looking around the men and dwarves were mostly talking

          
          07:40:10
          of distant events and telling news of a kind that was becoming only too familiar there was trouble away in the South and it seemed that the men who had come up the greenway were on the Move looking for lands where they could find some peace the Brie folk were sympathetic but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into their land one of The Travelers a squint eyed ill-favored fellow was foretelling that more and more people would be coming north in the near future if room isn't found for them

          
          07:40:45
          they'll find it for themselves they have a right to live same as other folk he said loudly the local inhabitants didn't look pleased at the prospect The Hobbit didn't pay much attention to all this and it didn't at the moment seem to concern Hobbits big folk could hardly beg for lodgings in Hobbit holes they were more interested in Sam and Pippen who were now feeling quite at home and were chatting gay about events in the sh Pippen roused a good deal of laughter with un account of the collapse of the

          
          07:41:22
          roof of the Town Hall in Mel deling will witf foot the mayor and the fattest Hobbit in the West Farthing had been buried in chalk and came out like a flowered dumpling but there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy one of the bre Landers who seemed to have been in the sh several times wanted to know where the underhills lived and who they were related to suddenly Frodo noticed that a Strang looking weather beaten man sitting in the shadows near the wall was also listening in intently to the Hobby talk

          
          07:42:01
          he had a tall tanker in front of him and was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved his legs were stretched out before him showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well but had seen much wear and were now caked with mud a travel stained cloak of heavy dark green cloth was drawn close about him and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but the beam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits who's that Frodo asked when he got a chance to whisper to Mr butterbur

          
          07:42:40
          I don't think you introduced him him said the landlord in an answering whisper cocking an eye without turning his head I don't rightly know he's one of the wandering folk Ranger as we call them he seldom talks not but what he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind he dis appears for a month or a year and then he pops up again he was in and out pretty often last spring but I haven't seen him about lately what his right name is I've never heard but he's known around here as Strider goes about at a great Pace on his long Shanks

          
          07:43:16
          though he don't tell nobody what cause he has to hurry but there's no accounting for East and West as we say in Brie meaning the Rangers and the CH folk begging your pardon funny you should ask about him but at that moment Mr butterbar was called Away by a demand for more a and his last remark remained unexplained Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him as if he'd heard or guessed all that had been said presently with a wave of his hand and a nod he invited Frodo to come over and sit by

          
          07:43:52
          him as Frodo Drew near he threw back his hood showed a Shaggy head of dark hair flecked with gray and in a pale Stern face a pair of keen gray eyes I'm called Strider he said in a low voice I'm very pleased to meet you master Underhill if old butterbur got your name right he did said Frodo stiffly he felt far from comfortable under the stare of those Keen eyes well Master Underhill said Strider if I were you I should stop your young friends from talking too much drink fire and chance meeting are Pleasant enough

          
          07:44:35
          but well this isn't the sh there are queer folk about though I say it as shouldn't you may think he added with a Ry smile seeing Frodo's glance and there have been even stranger Travelers through Brie lately he went on watching Frodo's face Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing and Strider made no further sign his attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin to his alarm froda became aware that the ridiculous young toque encouraged by his success with a fat mayor of ml delving was now actually

          
          07:45:14
          giving a comic account of Bilbo's farewell party he was already giving an imitation of the speech and was drawing near to the astonishing disappearance Frodo was annoyed it was a harmless enough tale for most of the local Hobbits no doubt just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the river but some old butterbar for instance knew a thing or two and had probably heard rumors long ago about Bilbo's Vanishing it would bring the name of Baggins to their minds especially if there had been inquiries

          
          07:45:48
          in Brie after that name Frodo fidgeted wondering what to do Pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was getting and had become quite forgetful of their danger Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention the ring and that might well be disastrous you had better do something quick whispered Strider in his ear Frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk the attention of Pippin's audience was Disturbed some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and laughed and

          
          07:46:25
          clapped thinking that Mr unale had taken as much a was good for him Frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himself as was his habit when making a speech fingering the things in his pocket he felt the ring on its chain and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation it seemed to him somehow as if the suggestion came to him from outside from someone or something in the room he resisted the Temptation firmly and clasped the in his hand as if to

          
          07:47:00
          keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any Mischief at any rate it gave him no inspiration he spoke a few very suitable words as they would have said in the Sha we are all very much gratified by the kindness of your reception and I venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of friendship between the sh and Brie and then he hesitated and coughed everyone in the room was now looking at him a song shouted one of the hobbits a song a song shouted all the others come on now

          
          07:47:39
          master sing us something that we haven't heard before for a moment Frodo stood gaping then in desperation he began a ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of for he'd made up the words himself it was about an in and that's prob probably why it came into Frodo's mind just then here it is in full only a few words of it are now as a rule remembered there is an in a med old in beneath an old gry Hill and there they brew a beer so Brown that the Man in the Moon himself came down one night to

          
          07:48:21
          drink his fill the Osler has a Tipsy cat that plays a five string fiddle and up and down he runs his bow now squeaking high now purring low now sowing in the middle the landlord keeps a little dog that is mighty fond of jokes when there's good cheer among the guests he an ear at all the JS and laughs until he chokes they also keep a horned cow as proud as any Queen but music turns her head like ale and makes her wave her tough to tail and dance upon the green and oh the RO of silver dishes and the store of Silver Spoons for

          
          07:49:03
          Sunday there's a special pair and these they polish up with Care on Saturday afternoons The Man in the Moon was drinking deep and the cat began to wail add dished a spoon on the table danced the cow in the Garden madly pranced and the little dog chased his tail The Man in the Moon took another mug and then rolled beneath his chair and there he dozed and dreamed of Alee till in the sky the stars were pale and Dawn was in the air then the Osler said to his Tipsy cat the white horses of the Moon they nay

          
          07:49:39
          and champ their silver bits but their m is bean and drown his wits and the sun will be rising soon so the cat on his fiddle played hey diddle diddle a jig that would wake the dead he squeaked and soared and quickened the tune while the landlord shook the man and the moon it's after three he said they rolled the man slowly up the hill and bundled him into the Moon while his horses galloped up in rear and the cow came capering like a deer and a dish ran up with a spoon now quicker the fiddle went dle dum diddle the dog began

          
          07:50:13
          to Roar the cow and the hes stood on their heads the guests all bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor with a ping and a pong the fiddle strings broke the cow jumped over the moon the little dog laughed To see such fun and the Saturday dish went off at to run with a silver Sundy spoon the Round Moon rolled behind the hill as the sun raised up her head she hardly believed her fiery eyes for though it was day to her surprise they all went back to bed there was loud and long Applause Frodo had a good voice and the song

          
          07:50:50
          tickled their fancy where's old barley they cried he ought to hear this Bob ought to learn his cat fiddle and then we'd have a dance they called for more Alee and began to shout let's have it again Master come on now once more they made Frodo have another drink and then begin his song again while many of them joined in for the tune was well known and they were quick at picking up words it was now Frodo's turn to feel pleased with himself he capered about on the table and when he came a second time to

          
          07:51:26
          the cow jumped over the moon he leapt in the air much too vigorously for he came down bang into a tray of mugs and slipped and rolled off the table with a crash clatter and bump the audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter and stopped short in gaping silence for the singer disappeared he simply vanished as if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a hole the local Hobbit stared in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shouted for bman all the company Drew away from Pippen and Sam who found themselves left

          
          07:52:06
          alone in a corner and eyed Darkly and doubtfully from a distance it was plain that many people regarded them now as the companions of a traveling Magician of unknown powers and purpose for there was one swy bander who stood looking at them with a knowing and half mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable Pres ly he slipped out of the door followed by the squint eyed Southerner the two had been whispering together a good deal during the evening Harry the gatekeeper also went out just

          
          07:52:40
          behind them Frodo felt a fool not knowing what else to do he crawled away under the tables to the dark corner by Strider who sat unmoved giving no sign of his thoughts Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the ring how it came to be on his finger he could not tell he could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket while he sang and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had not played him a trick

          
          07:53:18
          perhaps it had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt in the room he didn't like the looks of the men that had gone out well said Strider when he reappeared why did you do that worse than anything your friends could have said you have put your foot in it or should I say your finger I don't know what you mean said Frodo annoyed and alarmed oh yes you do answered Strider but we'd better wait until the Uproar has died down then if you please Mr Baggins I should like a

          
          07:53:56
          quiet word with you what about asked Frodo ignoring the sudden use of his proper name a matter of some importance to us both answered Strider looking Frodo in the eye you may hear something to your advantage very well said Frodo trying to appear unconcerned I'll talk to you later meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace Mr butterbar had come trotting in and he was now trying toen listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time I saw him Mr butur said a hobbit or least ways I didn't see him if you take

          
          07:54:39
          my meaning he just vanished Into Thin Air in a manner of speaking you don't say Mr mugart said the landlord looking puzzled yes I do replied mugart and I mean what I say what's more then there's some mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking his head there was too much of that Mr Underhill to go Vanishing Into Thin Air or into thick air as is more likely in this room well where is he now cried several voices how should I know he's welcome to go where he will so long as he pays in the morning there's Mr toque now he's

          
          07:55:20
          not vanished well I saw what I saw and I saw what I didn't said mwat obstinately and I say there's some mistake repeated butterbur picking up the tray and Gathering up the broken Crockery of course there's a mistake said Frodo I haven't vanished here I am I've just been having a few words with Strider in the corner he came forward Into the Fire Light but most of the company backed away even more perturbed than before they were not in the least Satisfied by his explanation that he crawled away quickly under the table after he had

          
          07:55:59
          fallen most of the hobbits and the men of Brie went off then and there in a huff having no fancy for further entertainment that evening one or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves the dwarves and the two or three strange men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord but not to Frodo and his friends before long no one was left but Strider who sat on unnoticed by the wall Mr butterbur didn't seem much put out he reckoned very probably that his house

          
          07:56:35
          would be full again on many future nights until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed now what have you been doing Mr Underhill he asked frightening my customers and breaking up my Croc with your acrobatics I'm very sorry to have caused any trouble said Frodo it was quite unintentional I assured you a most unfortunate accident all right Mr Underhill but if you're going to do any more tumbling or Conjuring or whatever it was you'd best warn folk beforehand and warn me we're a bit suspicious around here of anything

          
          07:57:15
          out of the way uncanny if you understand me and we don't take to it all of a sudden I Shan be doing anything of the sort again Mr butterbur I promise you and now I think I'll be getting to bed we shall be making an early start will you see that our Ponies are ready by 8:00 very good but before you go I should like a word with you in private Mr Underhill something has just come back to my mind that I ought to tell you I hope that you'll not take it a miss when I've seen to a thing or two I'll come along to your room if you're

          
          07:57:50
          willing certainly said Frodo but his heart sank he wondered how many private talks he would have before going to to bed and what they would reveal were these people all in League against him he began to suspect even old Butter's fat face of concealing dark designs chapter 10 Strider Frodo Pippin and Sam made their way back to the Parlor there was no light Mary was not there and the fire had burned low it was not until they had puffed up the Embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of that they discovered

          
          07:58:35
          Strider had come with them there he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door hello said Pippen who are you and what do you want I am called Strider he answered and though he may have forgotten it your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me you said I might hear something to my advantage I believe said Frodo what have you to say several things answered Strider but of course I have my price what do you mean asked Frodo sharply don't be alarmed I mean just this I'll tell you what I know and give you some

          
          07:59:15
          good advice but I shall want a reward and what will that be prey said Frodo he suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him all of it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he could not spare any of it no more than you can afford answered Strider with a slow Smile as if he guessed Frodo's thoughts just this you must take me along with you until I wish to leave you oh indeed replied Frodo surprised but not much relieved even if I wanted

          
          07:59:54
          another companion I should not agree to any such thing until I knew a good deal more about you and your business excellent exclaimed Strider Crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably you seem to be coming to your senses again and that is all to the good you've been much too careless so far very well I'll tell you what I know and leave the reward to you you may be glad to Grant it when you've heard me go on then said froto what do you know too much too many dark things said Strider grimly but as for your business he got

          
          08:00:32
          up and went to the door opened it quickly and looked out then he shot it quietly and sat down again I have quick ears he went on lowering his voice and though I cannot disappear I have hunted many wild and wey things and I can usually avoid being seen if I wish now I was behind the Hedge this evening on the road west of Brie when four Hobbits came out of the downlands I need not rep repeat all that they said to Old Bombadil or to one another but one thing interested me please remember said one of them that

          
          08:01:06
          the name Baggins must not be mentioned I am Mr Underhill if any name must be given that interested me so much that I followed them here I slipped over the gate just behind them maybe Mr Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind but if so I should advise him and his friends to be more careful I I don't see what interest my name has for anyone in Brie said Frodo angrily and I've still to learn why it interests you Mr Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping but if so I

          
          08:01:41
          should advise him to explain it well answered said Strider laughing but the explanation is simple I was looking for a hobbit called Frodo Baggins I wanted to find him quickly I had learned that he was carrying out of the sh well a secret that conc and me and my friends now don't mistake me he cried as Frodo Rose from his seat and Sam jumped up with a scowl I shall take more care of the secret than you do and Care is needed he leaned forward and looked at them watch every shadow he said in a low

          
          08:02:15
          voice black Horsemen have passed through Brie on Monday one came down the greenway they say and another appeared later coming up the Green Way from the south there was there was a silence at last Frodo spoke to Pippen and Sam I ought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us he said and the landlord seems to have heard something why did he press us to join the company and why on Earth did we behave so foolishly we ought to have stayed quiet in here it would have been better said

          
          08:02:50
          Strider I would have stopped your going into the common room if I could but the inkeeper would not let me in to see you or take a message do you think he began Frodo no I don't think any harm of old butterbar only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort froda gave him a puzzled look well I have rather a rascally look have I not said Strider with a curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye but I hope we shall get to know one another better when we do I hope you will explain what

          
          08:03:25
          happened at the end of your song for that little Frank it was sheer accident interrupted Frodo I wonder said Strider accident then that accident has made your position dangerous hardly more than it was already said Frodo I knew these Horsemen were pursuing me but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away you must not count on that said Strider sharply they will return and more are coming there are others I know their number I know these Riders he paused and his eyes were cold

          
          08:04:02
          and hard and there are some folk in Bri who are not to be trusted he went on Bill fery for instance he has an evil name in the bre land and queer folk call at his house you must have noticed him among the company a swy sneering fellow he was very close with one of the Southern strangers and they slipped out together just after your accident not all of those Southerners mean well and as for Fernie he would sell anything to anybody or make Mischief for amusement what will Fernie sell and what has my accident got to do with him said

          
          08:04:39
          Frodo still determined not to understand strider's hints news of you of course answered Strider an account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people after that they would hardly need to be told your real name it seems to me only too likely that they will hear of before this night is over is that enough you can do as you like about my reward take me as a guide or not but I may say that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains for I have wandered over them

          
          08:05:12
          for many years I am older than I look I might prove useful you will have to leave the open road after tonight for the horsemen will watch it night and day you may escape from Bri and be allowed to go forward while the Sun is up but but you won't get far they will come on you in the wild in some dark place where there's no help do you wish them to find you they are terrible the hobbits looked at him and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain and His Hands clenched the arms of his chair the

          
          08:05:47
          room was very quiet and still and the light seemed to have grown dim for a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the night far away there he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do you fear them but you do not fear them enough yet tomorrow you will have to escape if you can Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trotten will you have him there was a heavy silence Frodo made

          
          08:06:25
          no answer his mind was confused with and fear Sam frowned and looked at his master and at last he broke out with your leave Mr Frodo I'd say no this Trier here he warns and he says take care and I say yes to that and let's begin with him he comes out of the wild and I never heard no good of such folk he knows something that's plain and more than I like but it's no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help as he puts it Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable Strider didn't reply to

          
          08:07:04
          Sam but turned his Keen eyes on Frodo Frodo caught his glance and looked away no he said slowly I don't agree I think I think you're not really as you choose to look you began to talk to me like the Brie folk but your voice is changed still Sam seems right in this I don't see why you should warn us to take care and yet ask us to take you on trust why the disguise who are you what do you really know about about my business and how do you know it the lesson in caution has been well learned said Strider with a grim smile

          
          08:07:44
          but caution is one thing and wavering is another you will never get to rivendel now on your own and to trust me as your only chance you must make up your mind I will answer some of your questions if that will help you to so but why should you believe my story if you don't trust me already still here it is at that moment there came a knock at the door Mr butterbar had arrived with candles and behind him was knob with cans of hot water Strider withdrew into a dark corner I've come to bid you good night

          
          08:08:19
          said the landlord putting the candles on the tables knob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the door it's like this he began hesitating and looking troubled if I've done any harm I'm sorry indeed but one thing drives out another as you'll admit and I'm a busy man but first one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory as the saying goes and not too late I hope you see I was asked to look out for Hobbits of the Shire and for one by the name of baggin in particular and what has that got to do

          
          08:08:55
          with me asked froto ah you know best said the landlord knowingly I won't give you away but I was told that this baggin would be going by the name of Underhill and I was given a description that fits you well enough if I may say so indeed let's have it then said Frodo unwisely interrupting a stout little fellow with red cheeks said Mr butterbur solemnly Pippen chuckled but Sam looked indignant that won't help you much it goes for most Hobbits barley he says to me continued Mr buttero with a glance at Pippen but this one is

          
          08:09:34
          taller that Sam and fairer than most and he has a Clift in his chin perky chap with a bright eye begging your pardon but he said it not me he said it and who was he asked Frodo eagerly ah that was gandal if you know who I mean a wizard they say he is but he's a good friend of mine whether NE or no but now I don't know what he'll have to say to me if I see him again turn all my Al sour on me into a block of wood I shouldn't wonder he's a bit Hasty still what's done can't be undone well what have you done said Frodo getting

          
          08:10:14
          impatient with the slow unraveling of Butter's thoughts where was I said the landlord pausing and snapping his fingers ah yes old Gandalf 3 months back he walked right into my room without a knock barley he says I'm off in the morning will you do something for me you've only to name it I said I'm in a hurry said he and I have no time myself but I want a message took to the sh have you anyone you can send and Trust to go I can find someone I said tomorrow maybe or the day after make it tomorrow he

          
          08:10:51
          says and then he gave me a letter it's addressed plain enough said Mr producing a letter from his pocket and reading out the address slowly and proudly he valued his reputation as a lettered man Mr Frodo Baggins bag and hobbiton in the Shire a letter for me from Gandalf cried Frodo ah said Mr butterbar then your right name is Baggins it is said Frodo and you had better give me that letter at once and explain explain why you never sent it that's what you came to tell me I suppose though you've taken a

          
          08:11:32
          long time to come to the point poor Mr butterbar looked troubled you're right Master he said and I beg your pardon and I'm mortal afraid of what gandal would say if harm comes of it but I didn't keep it back a purpose I put it by safe then I couldn't find anybody willing to go to the sh next day nor the day after and none of my own folk were despare and then one thing after another drove it out of my mind I'm a busy man I'll do what I can to set matters right and if there's any help I can give you've only

          
          08:12:06
          to name it leaving the letter aside I promise Gandalf no l barley he says to me this friend of mine from the sh he may be coming out this way before long him and another he'll be calling himself Underhill mind that but you need ask no questions and if I'm not with him he may be in trouble and may need help do whatever you can for him and I'll be grateful he says and here you are and trouble is not far off seemingly what do you mean asked Frodo these black men said the landlord lowering his voice they're looking for

          
          08:12:44
          Baggins and if they mean well then I'm a hobbit it was on Monday and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming uncanny I called it Knob he came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit called bagins knobs hair was all stood on end I bid the black fellas be off and slammed the door on them but they've been asking the same question all the way to archit I hear and that Ranger Strider he's been asking questions too tried to get in here to see you before you had bite or

          
          08:13:18
          sa he did he did said Strider suddenly coming forward into the light and much trouble would have been saved if you'd let him in bman the landlord jumped with surprise you he cried you're always popping up what do you want now he's here with my leave said Frodo he came to offer me his help well you may know your own business maybe said Mr butterbur looking suspiciously at Strider but if I was in your plight I wouldn't take up with a ranger then who would you take up with asked Strider a fat inkeeper who only remembers his own

          
          08:13:58
          name because people shouted at him all day they cannot stay in the pony forever and they cannot go home they have a long road before them will you go with them and keep the black men off me leave Brie I wouldn't do that for any money said Mr butterbar looking really scared but why can't you stay here quiet for a bit Mr Underhill what are all these queer going on what are these black men after and where do they come from I'd like like to know I'm sorry I can't explain it all answered Frodo I'm tired and very

          
          08:14:33
          worried and it's a long Tale But if you mean to help me I ought to warn you that you'll be in danger as long as I'm in your house these Black Riders I'm not sure but I think I fear they come from they come from Mordor said Strider in a low voice from Mordor bimman if that means anything to you save us cried Mr butterbar turning pale the name evidently was known to him that is the worst news that's come to Bri in my time it is said Frodo are you still willing to help me I am said Mr butterbur more

          
          08:15:12
          than ever though I don't know what the likes of me can do against against he faltered against the shadow in the East said Strider quietly not much baryan but every little help you can let Mr Underhill stay here tonight as Mr Underhill and you can forget the name of bgins till his far away I'll do that said butur but they'll find out he's here without help from me I'm afraid it's a Pity Mr Baggins Drew attention to himself this evening to say no more the story of that Mr Bilbo's going off has been heard before tonight

          
          08:15:51
          in Brie even our knob has been doing some guessing in his slow pate and there are others in Bri quicker in the uptake than he is well we can only hope the Riders won't come back yet said Frodo I hope not indeed said butur but Spooks are no Spooks they won't get in the pony so easy don't you worry till the morning Noble say no word no black man shall pass my doors while I can stand on my legs me and my folk will keep watch the night but you had best get some sleep if you can in any case we must be called it Dawn said Frodo we

          
          08:16:28
          must get off as early as possible breakfast at 6:30 please right I'll see to the orders said the landlord good night Mr beggins Underhill I should say good night now bless me where's your Mr brandybuck I don't know said froda with sudden anxiety they'd forgotten All About Mary and it was getting late I'm afraid he's out he said something about going for a breath of air well you do want looking after no mistake your party might be on a holiday said butur I must go and bar the doors quick but I'll see

          
          08:17:06
          your friend is let in when he comes I'd better send knob to look for him good night to you all at last Mr butterbur went out with another doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head his footsteps retreated down the passage well said Strider when are you going to open that letter Frodo looked carefully at the seal before he broke it it seemed certainly to be Gandalf's inside written in the Wizard's strong but graceful script was the following message the prancing pony Brie mid Year's Day shy year

          
          08:17:47
          1418 dear Frodo bad news has reached me here I must go off at once you had better leave bagend soon and get out of the sh before the end of July at latest I will return as soon as I can and I will follow you if I find that you are gone leave a message for me here if you pass through Brie you can trust the landlord butterbur you may meet a friend of mine on the road a man lean dark tall by some called Strider he knows our business and will help you make for rivendel there I hope we may meet again if I do not come

          
          08:18:28
          elron will advise you yours in haste Gandalf P.S do not use it again not for any reason whatever do not travel by Night PPS make sure that it is the real Strider there are many strange men on the roads his true name is Aragorn all that is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost the old that is strong does not wither deep roots are not reached by the frost From the Ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadow shall spring renewed shall be blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king

          
          08:19:17
          p p ps I hope butur sends this promptly a worthy man but his memor is like a lumber room thing wanted all was buried if he forgets I shall roast him farewell Frodo read the letter to himself and then passed it to Pippen and Sam really old butterbur has made a mess of things he said he deserves roasting if I'd got this at once we might all have been safe in rivendel by now but what could have happened to Gandalf he writes as if he was going into great danger he has been doing that for many years said Strider Frodo turned and

          
          08:20:00
          looked at him thoughtfully wondering about Gandalf's second postcript why didn't you tell me that you were gandal friend at once he asked it would have saved time would it would any of you have believed me till now said Strider I knew nothing of this letter for all I knew I had to persuade you to trust me without proofs if I was to help you in any case I did not intend to tell you all about myself at once I had to study you first and make sure of you the enemy has set traps for me before now as soon as I had made up my

          
          08:20:36
          mind I was ready to tell you whatever you asked but I must admit he added with a queer laugh that I hoped you would take to me for my own sake a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and Longs for friendship but there I believe my looks are against me they are at first sight at any rate laughed Pippen with sudden relief after reading Gandalf's letter but handsome is as handsome does as we say in the sh and I dare say we shall all look much the same after lying for days in Hedges and ditches it would take more than a few

          
          08:21:12
          days or weeks or years of wandering in the wild to make you look like Strider he answered and you would die first unless you are made of Sterner stuff than you look to be Pippen subsided but Sam was not daunted and he still eyed Strider dubiously how do you know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about he demanded you never mentioned Gandalf till this letter came out you might be a play acting spy for all I can see trying to get us to go with you you might have done in the real Strider and took his

          
          08:21:48
          clothes what have you to say to that that you are a stout fellow answered Strider but I'm afraid my only answer to you Sam gangji is this if I had killed the real Strider I could kill you and I should have kill you already without so much talk if I was after the ring I could have it now he stood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller in his eyes gleamed a light keen and commanding throwing back his cloak he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side they did not dare to move s sat

          
          08:22:27
          wide mouthed staring at him dumbly but I am the real Strider fortunately he said looking down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile I am Aragorn son of arthorn and if by life or death I can save you I will there was a long silence at last Frodo spoke with hesitation I believe that you were a friend before the letter came he said or at least I wished to you frightened me several times tonight but never in the way that Servants of the enemy would or so I imagine I think one of his spies

          
          08:23:08
          would well seem fairer and feel Fowler if you understand I see laughed Strider I look foul and feel fair is that it all that is gold does not glitter not all who wander are lost did the verses apply to you you then asked Frodo I couldn't make out what they were about but how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter if you've never seen it I did not know he answered but I am Aragorn and those verses go with that name he drew out his sword and they saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the

          
          08:23:48
          hilt not much use is it Sam said Strider but the time is near when it shall be forged a new Sam said nothing well said Strider with Sam's permission we will call that settled Strider shall be your guide we shall have a rough road tomorrow even if we are allowed to leave Bri unhindered we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed but I shall try to get lost as soon as possible I know one or two ways out of breand other than the main road if once we shake off the pursuit I shall make for weathertop weathertop said Sam what's

          
          08:24:28
          that it's a hill just to the north of the road about halfway from here to Rivendell it commands a wide view all round and there we shall have a chance to look about us gandal will make for that point if he follows us after weathertop our journey will become more difficult and we shall have to choose between various dangers when did you last see Gandalf asked Frodo do you know where he is or what he's doing Strider looked grave I don't know he said I came West with him in the spring I've often kept watch on

          
          08:25:06
          the borders of the Shire in the last few years when he was busy elsewhere he seldom left it unguarded we last met on the 1st of May at San Ford down the Brandywine he told me that his business with you had gone well and that you would be starting for rivendel in the last week of September as I knew he was a your side I went away on a journey of my own and that has proved ill for plainly some news reached him and I was not at hand to help I'm troubled for the first time since I've known him we should have had messages even if he

          
          08:25:42
          could not come himself when I returned many days ago I heard the ill news the tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen it was the Elven folk of gildor that told me this and later they told me that you had left your home but there was no news of your leaving Buckland I've been watching the East Road anxiously do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it with Gandalf's absence I mean asked Frodo I don't know of anything else that could have hindered him except the enemy

          
          08:26:17
          himself said Strider but don't give up hope Gandalf is greater than you shy folk know as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys but this business of ours will be his greatest task Pippin yawned oh I'm sorry he said but I'm dead tired in spite of all the danger and worry I must go to bed or sleep where I sit where is that silly fellow Mary it would be the last straw if we had to go out in the dark to look for him at that moment they heard a door slam then feet came running along the passage Mary came in with a rush

          
          08:26:58
          followed by knob he shut the door hastily and leaned against it he was out of breath they stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped I seen them Frodo I've seen them Black Riders Black Riders cried Frodo where here in the village I stayed indoors for an hour then as you did not come back I went out for stroll I'd come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near there was a sort of Deeper Shade among the Shadows

          
          08:27:34
          across the road just beyond the edge of the Lamplight it slid away at once into the dark without a sound there was no horse which way did it go asked Strider suddenly and sharply Mary started noticing the stranger for the first time go on said Frodo this is a friend of Gandalf's I'll explain later it's seemed to make off up the road Eastward continued Mary I tried to follow of course it vanished almost at once but I went around the corner and on as far as the last house on the road Strider looked at Mary with wonder you have a

          
          08:28:13
          stout heart he said but it was foolish I don't know said Mary neither Brave nor silly I think I could hardly help myself I seem to be drawn somehow anyway I went and suddenly I heard voices by the Hedge one was muttering and the other was whispering or hissing I couldn't hear a word that was said I didn't creep any closer because I began to tremble all over then I felt terrified and I turned back and was just going to bolt home when something came behind me and I I fell over I found him sir put a knob Mr

          
          08:28:54
          butterbear sent me out with a lantern I went down to Westgate and then back up towards Southgate just I buil fernie's house I thought I could see something in the road I couldn't swear to it but it looked to me as if two men were stooping over something lifting it I gave a shout but when I got up to the spot there was no signs of them and only Mr brandyb Lying by the roadside he seemed to be asleep I thought I'd fallen into deep water he says to me when I shook him very queer he was and as soon as I'd

          
          08:29:29
          roused him he got up and ran back here like a hair I'm afraid that's true said Mary though I don't know what I said I had an ugly dream which I can't remember I went to pieces I don't know what came over me I do said Strider the black breath the Riders must have left the horses outside and passed back through the Southgate in secret they will know all than he was now for they visited Bill fery and probably that Southerner was a spy as well something may happen in the night before we leave Bri what will happen said Mary will they

          
          08:30:08
          attack the Inn no I think not said Strider they're not all here yet and in any case that is not their way in dark and loneliness they are strongest they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people not until they're desperate not while all the long leagues of arador still lie before us but their power is in Terror and already some in Bri are in their clutch they will drive these wretches to some evil work fery and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too they had words with Harry at Westgate on

          
          08:30:44
          Monday I was watching them he was white and shaking when they left him we seem to have enemies all around said Frodo what are we to do stay here and do do not go to your rooms they're sure to have found out which those are The Hobbit rooms have Windows looking North and close to the ground we'll all remain together and bar this window and the door but first knob and I will fetch your luggage while Strider was gone Frodo gave Mary a rapid account of all that had happened since supper Mary was still

          
          08:31:19
          reading and pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider and knob returned well Masters said knob I've ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of each bed and I made a nice imitation of your head with a brown Woolen hat Mr beg Underhill sir he added with a grin Pippen laughed very lifelike he said but what will happen when they've penetrated the disguise we shall see said Strider let's hope to hold the for till morning good night to you said knob and went off to take his part in the watch on the doors

          
          08:31:57
          their bags and gear they piled on the Parlor floor they pushed a low chair against the door and shut the window peering out Frodo saw that the night was still clear the sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of Brie Hill he then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and Drew the curtains together Strider built up the fire and blew out the candles the hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the Hearth but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door they talked

          
          08:32:28
          for a little for medy still had several questions to ask jumped over the Boon chuckled Mary as he rolled himself in his blanket very ridiculous of you Frodo but I wish I'd been there to see the worthy of Brie will be discussing it a 100 years hence I hope so said Strider then they all fell silent and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep chapter 11 a knife in the dark as they prepared for sleep in the in at Bree Darkness lay on Buckland a Mist strayed in the Dells and along the River Bank the house at cric Hollow

          
          08:33:11
          stood silent fatty Bulger opened the door cautiously and peered out a feeling of fear had been growing on him all day and he was unable to rest or go to bed there was a brooding threat in the breathless night air as he stared out into the Gloom a black shadow moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound Terror seized him he shrank back and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall then he shut and locked the door the night deepened there came the

          
          08:33:48
          soft sound of horses LED with stealth along the lane outside the gate they stopped and three black figures entered like shades of night creeping across the ground one went to the door one to the corner of the house on either side and there they stood as still as the shadows of stones while night went slowly on the house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly there was a faint stir in the leaves and a crowed far away the cold hour before Dawn was passing the figure by the door moved in

          
          08:34:25
          the dark dark without moon or Stars a drawn blade gleamed as if a chill light had been un sheathed there was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuted open in the name of more door said a voice thin and menacing at a second blow the door yielded and fell back with Timbers burst and lock broken the black figures passed swiftly in at that moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out in rent the night like fire on a Hilltop awake fear fire foes awake fatty buer had not been idle as soon as he saw the dark shapes Creep

          
          08:35:08
          from the garden he knew that he must run for it or perish and run he did out of the back door through the garden and over the fields when he reached the nearest house more than a mile away he collapsed on the doorstep no no no he was crying no not me I haven't got it it it was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about at last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland some strange Invasion From The Old Forest and then they lost no more time fear fire foes the Brandy

          
          08:35:43
          bucks were blowing the horn call of Buckland that had not been sounded for a 100 years not since the white wolves came in the fell winter when the Brandy Wine was frozen over awake awake far away answering horns were heard the alarm was spreading the black figures fled from the house one of them let fall a hobbit cloak on the step as he ran in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and Gathering to a Gallop went hammering away into the darkness all about creck Hollow there was the sound of horns blowing and

          
          08:36:16
          voices crying and feet running but the Black Riders rode like a gale to the north gate let the people blow saon would deal with them lateer meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the house was empty and the ring had gone they rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shah in the early night Frodo woke from Deep Sleep suddenly as if some sound or presence had Disturbed him he saw that Strider was sitting Alert in his chair his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire which had been tendered and was

          
          08:36:53
          Burning Brightly but he made no sign or movement throo soon went to sleep again but his dreams were again troubled with a noise of wind and of Galloping Hooves the wind seemed to be curling around the house and shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly he opened his eyes and heard a growing lustily in The inyard Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang the first gray light of day was in the room and a cold air was coming through the open window as soon as Strider had roused them all

          
          08:37:28
          he led the way to their bedrooms when they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice the windows had been forced open and were swinging and the curtains were flapping the beds were tossed about and the bolster slashed and flung upon the floor the brown mat was Torn to Pieces Strider immediately went to fetch the landl Lord poor Mr butterbar looked sleepy and frightened he hardly closed his eyes all night so he said but he had never heard a sound never such a thing happened in my time he cried raising his hands in horor

          
          08:38:05
          guests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolsters ruined at all what are we coming to Dark Times said Strider but for the present you may be left in peace when you've got rid of us we will leave at once never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite standing we'll have to do we shall be packed in a few minutes Mr butterbar hurried off to see that their Ponies were got ready and to fetch them a bite but very soon he came back into his May the ponies had vanished the stable doors had all been opened in the

          
          08:38:39
          night and they were gone not only Mer's ponies but every other horse and beast in the place thodo was crushed by the news how could they hope to reach rivendel on foot pursued by mounted enemies they might as well set out for the mo Strider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits as if he was weighing up their strength and courage ponies would not help us to escape Horsemen he said at last thoughtfully as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind we should not go much slower on foot not on the roads that I mean to

          
          08:39:17
          take I was going to walk in any case it's the food and stores that trouble me we can't count on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell except what we take with us and we ought to take plenty to spare for we may be delayed or forced to go roundabout far out of the direct way how much are you prepared to carry on your backs as much as we must said Pippen with a sinking heart but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked or felt I can carry enough for two said Sam defiantly can't anything be done Mr

          
          08:39:54
          butterbar asked Frodo can't we get a couple of ponies in the village or even one just for the baggage I don't suppose we could hire them but we might be able to buy them he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it I doubt it said the landlord unhappily the two or three riding ponies that there were in Brie were stabled in my yard and they're gone as for other animals horses or ponies for draft or whatnot there are very few of them in Brie and they won't be for sale but I'll do what I can I'll route out Bob and

          
          08:40:30
          send him round as soon as maybe yes said Strider reluctantly you'd better do that I'm afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least but so ends all hope of starting early and slipping away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure that was part of their plan no doubt there's one crumb of comfort said Mary and more than a crumb I hope we can have breakfast while we wait and sit down to it let's get hold of Knob in the end there was more than 3 hours delay Bob came back with a report

          
          08:41:11
          that no horse or pony was to be got For Love or Money in the neighborhood except one bill Fernie had one that he might possibly sell a poor old half starved creature he is said Bob but he won't paed with it for less than Thrice its worth seeing how you're placed not if I know Bill Fernie Bill fery said Frodo isn't there some trick wouldn't the Beast bu back to him with all our stuff or help in tracking us or something I wonder said Strider but I can't imagine any animal running home to him once it got away I fancy this is

          
          08:41:51
          only an afterthought of kind Master feres just a way of increasing his profits from the affair the chief danger is that the poor Beast is probably at death's door but there does not seem any choice what does he want for it Bill fernie's price was 12 silver pennies and that was indeed at least three times the pony's value in those parts it proved to be a bony underfed and dispirited animal but it didn't look like dying just yet Mr butterbur paid for it himself and offered Mary another 18 P of some

          
          08:42:28
          compensation for the lost animals he was an honest man and well off as things were reckoned in Brie but 30 silver pennies was a sore blow to him and being cheated by Bill Fernie made it harder to bear as a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end it turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen the others had been driven off or had bolted in Terror and were found wandering in different corners of the Bree land Med's ponies had escaped altogether and eventually having a good deal of sense they made

          
          08:43:04
          their way to the Downs in search of fatty Lumpkin so they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while and were well off but when news of the events at Brie came to Tom's ears he sent them to Mr butterbur who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price they had to work harder in Brie but Bob treated them well so on the whole they were lucky they missed a dark and dangerous Journey but they never came to rivendel however in the meanwhile for all Mr butterbur knew his money was gone for good or for bad and he had other

          
          08:43:43
          troubles for there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were a stir and heard news of the raid on the Inn the southern Travelers had lost several horses and blamed the inkeeper loudly and till it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the night none other than Bill fernie's squint eyed companion suspicion fell on him at once if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting

          
          08:44:15
          at me go and ask Fernie where your handsome friend is but it happened that he was nobody's friend and nobody could recollect when he had joined their party after their breakfast the hobbits had to repack and get together further supplies for the longer Journey they were now expecting it was close on 10:00 before they got off at Last by that time the whole of Brie was buzzing with excitement Frodo's Vanishing trick the appearance of the black Horsemen the robbing of the stables and not least the news that stri

          
          08:44:53
          of the Ranger had joined the mysterious Hobbit made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years most of the inhabitants of Bri and stadle and many even from K and archet were crowded in the road to see The Traveler start the other guests in the Inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows Strider had changed his mind and he decided to leave Bri by the main road any attempt to set off across the country at once would only make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them to see what they are up to and to

          
          08:45:30
          prevent them from trespassing they said farewell to knob and Bob and took leave of Mr butterbur with many thanks I hope we shall meet again someday when things are merry once more said Frodo I should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace for a while they tramped off anxious and downhearted under the eyes of the crowd not not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted but Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the bre Landers and those that He stared at shut their mouths and Drew

          
          08:46:06
          away he walked in front with rodo next Came Mary and Pippen and last came Sam leading the pony which was Laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it but already it looked less dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully he had a pocket full of them a parting present from knob and Bob apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said but I reckon I'll miss them both before long the hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of

          
          08:46:43
          doors or popped over walls and fences as they passed but as they drew near to the further gate Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick hedge the last house in the village in one of the windows he caught a glimpse of a salow face with Sly slanting eyes but it vanished at once so that's where the Southerner is hiding he thought he looks more than half like a goblin Over the Hedge another man was staring boldly he had heavy black brows and dark scornful eyes his large mouth curled in a sneer he was smoking a short

          
          08:47:24
          black pipe as they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat morning long Shanks he said off early found some friends at last Strider nodded but did not answer morning my little friends he said to the others I suppose you know who you've taken up with that stick at North Strider that is though I've heard other names not so pretty watch out tonight and you s don't go ill treating my poor old Pony P he spat Again Sam turned quickly and you Fernie he said put your ugly face out of sight or it'll get hurt with a sudden flick

          
          08:48:11
          quick as lightning and apple left his hand and hit Bill Square on the nose he ducked too late and curses came from behind the Hedge whist of a good apple said Sam regretfully and stro on at last they leftt The Village behind the escort of children and stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the south gate passing through they kept on along the road for some miles it bent to the left curving back into its Eastward line as it rounded the feet of Brie Hill and then it began to run swiftly downwards

          
          08:48:49
          into wooded country to their left they could see some of the houses and Hobbit holes of St Shadle on the gentless Southeastern slopes of the Hill down in a deep Hollow away north of the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where Kum lay Arch it was hidden in the trees behind after the road had run down somewhere and had left Brie Hills Standing Tall and brown behind they came on a narrow track that led off towards the north this is where we leave the open and take to cover said Strider

          
          08:49:26
          not a shortcut I hope said Pippen our last shortcut through Woods nearly ended in disaster ah but you had not got me with you then laughed Strider my cuts short or long don't go wrong he took a look up and down the road no one was in sight and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded Valley his plan as far as they could understand it without knowing the country was to go towards Arch it at first but to Bear right and pass it on the East and then to steer as straight as he could over the wildlands to

          
          08:50:02
          weathertop Hill in that way they would if all went well cut off a Great Loop of the road which further on bent southwards to avoid the midwater marshes but of course they would have to pass through the marshes themselves and Striders description of them was not encouraging however in the meanwhile walking was not unpleasant indeed if it had not been for the disturbing events of the night before they would have enjoyed this part of the journey better than any up to that time the Sun was shining clear but not too hot the woods

          
          08:50:40
          in the valley were still leafy and full of color and seemed peaceful and wholesome Strider guided them confidently among the many crossing paths although left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss he was taking a one in course with many turns and doublings to put off any Pursuit Bill Fernie will have watched where we left the road for certain he said though I don't think he'll follow us himself he knows the land around here well enough but he knows is no match for me in a wood it's what he may tell

          
          08:51:14
          others that I'm afraid of I don't suppose they are far away if they think we've made for archit so much the better whether because of strider's skill or for some other reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day neither two-footed except Birds nor four-footed except one fox and a few squirrel the next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards and still all was quiet and peaceful on the third day out from brie they came out of the Chetwood the land had been falling steadily ever since

          
          08:51:55
          they turned aside from the road and they now entered a wide flat expanse of country much more difficult to manage they were far beyond the borders of the bre land out in the pathless wilderness and drawing near to the midwater marshes the ground now became damp and in places boggy and here and there They Came Upon pools and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with a warbling of little hidden Birds they had to pick their way carefully to keep both dry footed and on their proper course at first they made Fair progress but as

          
          08:52:31
          they went on their passage became slower and more dangerous the marshes were bewildering and treacherous and there was no permanent Trail even for Rangers to find through their shifting Quagmire the Flies began to torment them and the air was full of clouds of tiny mides that crept up their sleeves and britches and into their hair I'm being eaten alive cried Pippen midwater there are more midges than water what do they live on when they can't get hbit asked Sam scratching his neck they spent a miserable day in this lonely and

          
          08:53:07
          unpleasant country their camping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting insects would not let them sleep there were also abominable creatures haunting the Reeds and Tusk that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket there were thousands of them and they squeaked all round neck Breck brick neck unceasingly all the night until the hobbits were nearly frantic the next day the fourth was little better and the night almost as comfortless though the Nikas as Sam called them had been left behind the

          
          08:53:46
          Midas still pursued them as Frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the Eastern Sky it flashed and Faded many times it was not the dawn for that was still some hours off what is the light he said to Strider who had risen and was standing gazing ahead into the night I don't know Strider answered it's too distant to make out it's like lightning that leaps up from hilltops Frodo laid down again but for a long while he could still see the white

          
          08:54:25
          flashes and against them the tall dark figure of Strider standing silent and watchful at last he passed into uneasy sleep they had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling pools and readed beds of the marshes behind them the land before them began steadily to rise again away in the distance Eastward they could now see a line of Hills the highest of them was at the right of the line and a little separated from the others it had a conical shape slightly flattened at the summit that's weather top said Strider

          
          08:55:03
          the old road which we've left far away on our right runs to the south of it and passes not far from its foot we might reach it by noon tomorrow if we go straight towards it I suppose we'd better do so what do you mean asked Frodo I mean when we do get there it's not certain what we shall find it's close to the road but surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there yes but the hope is faint if he comes this way at all he may not pass through Brie and so he may not know what we're doing and anyway unless by

          
          08:55:39
          luck we arrive almost together we shall miss one another it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there long if the Riders fail to find us in the wilderness they're likely to make for weathertop themselves it commands a wide view all round indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us as we stand here from that Hilltop not all the birds are to be trusted and there are other spies more evil than they are the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant Hills Sam looked up into the

          
          08:56:11
          pale Sky fearing to see Hawks or Eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes you do make me feel uncomfortable and Lonesome Strider he said what do you advise us to do asked Frodo I think answered Strider slowly as if he was not quite sure I think the best thing is to go as straight Eastward from here as we can to make for the line of Hills not for weathertop there we can strike a path I know that runs at their feet it will bring us to weather toop from the north and less openly then we shall see what we shall

          
          08:56:50
          see all that day they plotted along until the cold and early evening came down the land became drier and more Barren but Mists and Vapors lay behind them on the marshes a few Melancholy birds were piping and wailing until the round red Sun sang slowly into the Western Shadows then an empty silence fell the hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful Windows of Bag End far away at the day's end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to look lose itself in the stagnant

          
          08:57:26
          Marshland and they went up along its banks while the light lasted it was already night when at last they halted and made their Camp under some stunted old trees by the shores of the stream ahead there loomed now against the Dusky Sky The Bleak and treeless backs of the hills that night they set a watch and Strider it seemed did not sleep at all the moon was waxing and in the early night hours a cold gray light lay on on the land next morning they set out again soon after Sunrise there was a frost in

          
          08:58:02
          the air and the sky was a pale clear blue the hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep already they were getting used to walking on short Commons shorter at any rate than what in the sh they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs Pippen declared that froda was looking Twice The Hobbit that he had been very odd said Frodo tightening his belt considering that there is actually a great deal less of me I hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely Or I shall become a wraith

          
          08:58:37
          do not speak of such things said Strider quickly and with surprising earnestness the hills Drew nearer they made an undulating Ridge often Rising almost to a th000 ft and here and there Falling Again to low Cliffs or passes leading into the Eastern land Beyond along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green grown walls and dkes and in the cliffs there still stood the ruins of old works of stone by night they had reached the feet of The Westward slopes and there they

          
          08:59:16
          camped it was the night of the 5th of October and they were 6 days out from brie in the morning they found for the first time since they had left the Chetwood a track plain to see they turned right and followed it southwards it ran cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible from The View both of the hilltops above and of the flats to the West it dived into Dells and hugged steep Banks and where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large

          
          08:59:55
          Boulders and he stones that screened The Travelers almost like a hedge I wonder who made this path and what for said Mary as they walked along one of these Avenues where the stones were unusually large and closely set I'm not sure that I like it it has a well rather a barrow wiish look is there any Barrow on weathertop no there's no barow on weathertop nor on any of these Hills answered Strider the men of the West did not live here though in their later days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of

          
          09:00:33
          Angar this path was made to serve the forts along the walls but long before in the first days of the north Kingdom they built a great Watchtower on weathertop Armon they called it it was burned and broken and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old Hills Head yet once it was tall and fair it is told that elendel stood there watching for the coming of Gil Gallard out of the West in the days of the last Alliance the hobbits gazed at Strider it seemed that he was learned in Old Law as

          
          09:01:11
          well as in the ways of the wild who was Gil galled asked Mary but Strider did not answer and seemed to be lost in thought suddenly a low voice murmured gilgalad was an Elven king of him the Harpers sadly sing the last whose realm was fair and free between the mountains and the Sea his sword was long his Lance was Keen his shining Helm afar was seen the countless stars of Heaven's field were mirrored in his Silver Shield but long ago he rode away and where he dwelleth none can say for Into Darkness

          fell his star in moreor where the Shadows are the others turned in amazement for the voice was Sam's don't stop said Mary that's all I know stammered Sam blushing I learned it from Mr Bilbo when I was a lad he used to tell me Tales like that knowing how I was always one for hearing about elves it was Mr Bilbo has taught me my letters he was mighty book Learned was dear old Mr Bilbo and he wrote poetry he wrote what I have just said he did not make it up said Strider it's part of the lay that is called the

          
          09:02:35
          fall of gilgalad which is in an ancient tongue Bilbo must have translated it I never knew that there was a lot more said Sam all about Mordor I didn't learn that part it gave me the Shivers I never thought I should be going that way myself going to Mordor cried Pippen I hope it won't come to that do not speak that name so loudly said Strider it was already midday when they drew near the southern end of the path and saw before them in the pale clear light of the October Sun a gray green Bank leading up like a bridge onto the

          
          09:03:18
          northward slope of the Hill they decided to make for the top at once while the daylight was broad concealment was no longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing them nothing was to be seen moving on the hill if Gandalf was anywhere about there was no sign of him on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered Hollow at the bottom of which there was a bowl-shaped Dell with grassy sides there they left Sam and Pippen with the pony and their packs and Luggage the other three went on after

          
          09:03:59
          half an hour's plotting climb Strider reached the crown of the Hill Frodo and Mary followed tired and breathless the last slope had been Steep and Rocky on the top they found as Strider had said a wide ring of ancient stone work now crumbling or covered with agong grass but in the center a can of broken Stones had been piled they were blackened as if with fire about them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched and shriveled as if Flames had swept the hilltop but there

          
          09:04:34
          was no sign of any living thing standing upon the rim of the ruined Circle they saw all round below them a wide Prospect for the most part of lands empty and featureless except for patches of Woodland away to the South Beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant water beneath them on this southern side there ran like a ribbon the old road coming out of the West and winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east nothing was moving on it following its line Eastward with

          
          09:05:11
          their eyes they saw the mountains the nearer Foothills were Brown and somber behind them stood taller shapes of gray and behind those again were high white Peaks glimmer ing among the clouds well here we are said Mary and very cheerless and uninviting it looks there's no water and no shelter and no sign of gandal but I don't blame him for not waiting if he ever came here I wonder said Strider looking round thoughtfully even if he was a day or two behind us at Bri he could have arrived here first he can ride very swiftly when

          
          09:05:52
          need presses suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the can it was flatter than the others and whiter as if it had escaped the far he picked it up and examined it turning it in his fingers this has been handled recently he said what do you think of those marks on the flat Underside Frodo saw some scratches this seems to be a stroke a DOT and three more Strokes he said the Str joke on the left might be a g- rune with thin branches said Strider it might be a sign left by Gandalf though one

          
          09:06:31
          cannot be sure the scratches are fine and they certainly look fresh but the marks might mean something quite different and have nothing to do with us Rangers use runes and they come here sometimes what could they mean even if Gandalf made them asked Mary I should say answered Strider that they stood for G3 and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the 3D that is 3 days ago now it would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand so that he had no time or did not dare to write

          
          09:07:06
          anything longer or planer if that is so we must be wey I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks whatever they may mean said Frodo it would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way in front of us or behind us perhaps said strider for myself I believe that he was here and was in danger there have been scorching Flames here and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the Eastern sky comes back to my mind I guess that he was attacked on this Hilltop but with what result I cannot

          
          09:07:42
          tell he is here no longer and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to rivendel as best we can how far is rivendel asked Mary gazing around wearily the world looked wild and wide from weathertop I don't know if the road has ever been measured in Miles Beyond The Forsaken Inn a Day's Journey east of ree answered Strider some say it is so far and some say otherwise it's a strange Road and folk are glad to reach their Journey's End whether the time is long or short but I know not how long it would take me on my

          
          09:08:20
          own feet with fair weather and no ill Fortune 12 days from here to the Ford of Bruin where the road crosses the loud water that runs out of rivendale we have at least a fortnight's journey before us for I do not think we shall be able to use the road a fortnight said Frodo a lot may happen in that time it may said Strider they stood for a while silent on the hilltop near its Southward Edge in that lonely Place Frodo for the first time fully realized his homelessness and danger he wished bitterly that his

          
          09:08:58
          fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved sh he stared down at the hateful Road leading back Westward to his home suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along it going Westward and looking again he saw that three others were creeping Eastward to meet them he gave a cry and clutched strider's arm look he said pointing downwards at once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined Circle pulling froda down beside him Mary threw himself alongside what is it he whispered I

          
          09:09:35
          don't know but I fear the worst answered Strider slowly they crawled up to the edge of the Ring again and peered through a cliff between two Jagged Stones the light was no longer bright for the clear morning had faded and clouds creeping out of the East had now overtaken the Sun as it began began to go down they could all see the black specks but neither Frodo nor Mery could make out their shapes for certain yet something told them that there far below were Black Riders assembling on the road beyond the foot of the Hill yes said

          
          09:10:10
          Strider whose Keen of sight left them in no doubt the enemy is here hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companions Sam and perigrine had not been idle they had explored the small Dell and the surrounding slopes not far away they found a spring of clear water in the Hillside and near it Footprints not more than a day or two old in the Dell itself they found recent traces of a far and other signs of a hasty Camp there were some Fallen rocks on the edge

          
          09:10:46
          of the Dell nearest to the hill behind them Sam Came Upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked I wonder if old Gandalf has been here he said to Pippen whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back at seems Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries I wish I had waited and explored the ground down here myself he said hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints it's just as I feared he said when he came back Sam and Pippen have trampled the soft ground and the marks are spoiled or confused Rangers have

          
          09:11:23
          been here lately it is they who left the firewood behind but there are also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers at least one set was made only a day or two ago by heavy boots at least one I cannot now be certain but I think there were many booted feet he paused and stood in anxious thought each of The Hobbit saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted Riders if the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner Strider LED them somewhere else the better Sam viewed the hollow with great

          
          09:12:00
          dislike now that he had heard news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away hadn't we better clear out quick Mr Strider he asked impatiently it's getting late and I don't like this hole it makes my heart sink somehow yes we certainly must decide what to do at once answered Strider looking up and considering the time and the weather well Sam he said at last I don't like this place either but I can't think of anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall at least we are out of sight

          
          09:12:36
          for the moment and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by Spies all we could do would be to go right out of our way back North on this side of the line of Hills where the land is all much the same as it is here the road is watched but we should have to cross it if we try to take cover in the thickets away to the south on the north side of the road Beyond The Hills the country is bare and flat for miles can the Riders see asked Mary I mean they seem usually to have used their noses rather than

          
          09:13:10
          their eyes smelling for us if smelling is the right word at least in the daylight but you made us lie down flat when you saw them down below and now you talk of being seen if we move I was too careless on the hilltop answered Strider I was very anxious to find some sign of Gandalf but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long for the black horses can see and the Riders can use men and other creatures as spies as we found at Brie they themselves do not see the world of light as we do but our shapes

          
          09:13:46
          cast shadows in their minds which only the noon Sun destroys and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us then they are most to be feared and at all times they smell the blood of living things Desiring and hating it senses too there are other than sight or smell we can feel their presence it troubled our hearts as soon as we came here and before we saw them they feel ours more keenly also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the ring draws them near is there no Escape then said Frodo

          
          09:14:29
          looking around wildly if I move I shall be seen and hunted if I stay I shall draw them to me Strider laid his hand on his shoulder there is still hope he said You are not alone let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign there is Little Shelter or defense here but fire Shall Serve for both siren can put are to his evil uses as he can all things but these Riders do not love it and fear those who wield it fire is our friend in the wilderness maybe buted Sam it's also as good a way of saying here we are as I

          
          09:15:10
          can think of bar shouting down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the Dell they lit a fire and prepared a meal the shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold they were suddenly aware of great hunger for they had not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared not make more than a Frugal supper the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the world Rangers passed at times Beyond The Hills but they were few and did not stay

          
          09:15:48
          other wanders were rare and of evil sorts trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the Misty Mountains only on the road would Travelers be found most often dwars hurrying Along on business of their own and with no help and few words to spare for strangers I don't see how our food can be made to last said Frodo we've been careful enough in the last few days and this supper's no Feast but we've used more than we ought if we have two weeks still to go and perhaps more there is food in the wild said Strider B

          
          09:16:27
          root and herb and I have some skill as a hunter at need you need not be afraid of starving before winter comes but Gathering and catching food is long and weary work and we need haste so tighten your belts and think with hope of the tables of elon's house the cold increased as Darkness came on peering out from the edge of the Dell they could see nothing but a gray land now Vanishing quickly into Shadow the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars thodo and his companions huddled

          
          09:17:04
          around the fire wrapped in every garment and blanket they possessed but Strider was content with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughtfully at his pipe as night fell and the light of the far began to shine out brightly he began to tell them Tales to keep them Minds from Fear he knew many histories and legends of long ago of elves and men and the good and evil Deeds of the Elder days they wondered how old he was and where he had learned all this law tell us of Kil gallad said Mary

          
          09:17:40
          suddenly when he paused at the end of a story of the elf kingdoms do you know any more of that old leay that you spoke of I do indeed answered Strider so also does Frodo for it concerns us closely Mary and Pippen looked at Frodo who was staring into the fire I know only the little that Gandalf has told me said Frodo slowly gilgalad was the last of the great elf Kings of Middle Earth gilgalad is Starlight in their tongue with elendil the elf friend he went to the land of no said Strider interrupting

          
          09:18:16
          I don't think that tale should be told now with the Servants of the enemy at hand if we win through to the house of el you may hear it there told and full then tell us some other tale of the old days begged Sam a tale about the elves before the fading time I would dearly like to hear more about elves the dark seems to press around so close I will tell you the tale of uial said Strider in brief for it's a long tale of which the end is not known and there are none now except elrond that remember it a right as it was told of

          
          09:18:55
          old it is a fair tale though it's sad as are all the tales of Middle Earth and yet it may lift up your hearts he was silent for some time and then he began not to speak but to chant softly the leaves were long the grass was green the hemlock umbles tall and fair and in the Glade a light was seen of stars in Shadow shimmering Tino was dancing there to music of a pipe unseen and light of stars was in her hair and in her rment glimmering there Baron came from Mountains Cold and lost he wandered under leaves and where the Elven River

          
          09:19:39
          rolled he walked alone and Sorrowing he peered between the hemlock leaves and saw in Wonder flowers of gold upon her mantle and her sleeves and her hair like Shadow following enchantment healed his weary feet that over Hills were doomed to roam and forth he hastened strong and Fleet and grasped at Moon beams glistening through woven Woods in Elven home she lightly fled on Dancing feet and left him lonely still to roam in the silent forests listening he heard thereof the flying sound of feet as light as Linder leaves

          
          09:20:22
          or music Welling underground in Hidden Hollows quavering now withered lay the hemlock sheaves and one by one with sighing sound Whispering fell the beach and leaves in the wintry Woodland wavering he sought her ever wandering far where leaves of years were thickly stwn by light of moon and Ray of star in Frosty Heavens shivering a mantle glinted in the moon as on a Hilltop High and far she danced and at her feet was stwn a mist of silver quivering when winter passed she came again and a song released the sudden

          
          09:21:03
          spring like Rising lar and falling rain and melting water bubbling he saw the Elven flowers spring about her feet and healed again he longed by her to dance and sing upon the grass untr troubling again she fled but Swift he came tinel tinel he called her by her Elish name and there she halted listening one moment stood she and a spell his voice laid on her Baron came and doom fell on to newel that in his arms lay glistening as Baron looked into her eyes within the shadows of her hair the trembling Starlight of the Skies he saw

          
          09:21:50
          their miror shimmering OV El the Elven Fair Immortal Maiden Elven wise about him cast her shadowy hair and arms like silver glimmering long was the way that fate them bore or Stony Mountains Cold and gray through holes of iron and darkling door and woods of nightshade Mor oress the suering Seas between them lay and yet at last they met once more and long ago they passed away in the forest singing sorrowless stride aside and paused before he spoke again that is a song He said in the mode that is called anath among the elves but

          
          09:22:40
          is hard to render in our common speech and this is but a rough echo of it it tells of the meeting of Baron son of barahir and luthan uel baron was a mortal man but luthian was the daughter of thingol a king of elves upon Middle Earth when the world was young and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all the children of this world as the stars above the Mists of the northern lands was her loveliness and in her face was a Shining Light in those days the great enemy of whom Sauron of Mordor was but a

          
          09:23:16
          servant dwelt in angband in the North and the elves of the West coming back to to Middle Earth made War upon him to regain the sarel which he had stolen and the fathers of men aided the elves but the enemy was Victorious and barir was slain and baron escaping through great Peril came over the mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of thingol in the forest of narth there he beheld luian singing and dancing in a Glade beside the enchanted river ealn and he named her tenial that is Nightingale in the language of old many

          
          09:23:58
          Sorrows befell them afterwards and they were parted long ovial rescued Baron from The Dungeons of saurin and together they passed through great dangers and cast down even the great enemy from his throne and took from his iron Crown one of the three silmarils brightest of all jewels to be the bride price of Luan to thingol her father yet at the last ban was slain by the wolf that came from the gates of angband and he died in the arms of uial but she chose mortality and to die from the world so that she might follow

          
          09:24:37
          him and it is sung that they met again beyond the sundering seas and after a brief time walking alive once more in the Green Woods together they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world so it is that Luan uel alone of the elf Kindred has died indeed and left the world and they have lost her whom they most loved but from her the lineage of the elf Lords of old descended among men there live still those of whom Luan was the foremother and it is said that her line shall never fail El Rond of

          
          09:25:16
          rivendel is of that kin for of Baron and Luan was born Deo thingal a and of him elwing the white whom arendel wedded he that sailed his ship out of The Mists of the world into the Seas of heaven with a saril upon his brow and of a andil came the kings of numor that is westernness as Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face dimly lit in the red glow of the Woodfire his eyes sha and his voice was rich and deep above him was a black Starry Sky suddenly a pale light appeared over the

          
          09:25:55
          crown of weathertop behind him the waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that over shadowed them and the stars above the hilltop faded the story ended the hobbits moved and stretched look said Mary the Moon is rising it must be getting late the others looked up even as they did so they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise it was perhaps only a large stone or jutting Rock shown up by The Pale Light Sam and Mary got up and walked away from the far Frodo and Pippen

          
          09:26:34
          remained seated in silence Strider was watching The Moonlight on the hill intently all seemed quiet and still but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart now that Strider was no longer speaking he huddled closer to the fire at that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the Dell I don't know what it is he said but I suddenly felt afraid I DST and go outside this Dell for any money I felt that something was creeping up the slope did you see anything asked Frodo springing to his feet no sir I saw nothing but I didn't

          
          09:27:14
          stop to look I saw something said Mary or I thought I did away westwards where the Moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the hilltops I thought there were two or three black shapes they seem to be moving this way keep close to the fire with your faces outward cried Strider get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands for a breathless time they sat there silent and alert with their backs turned to the Woodfire each gazing into the Shadows that encircled them nothing happened

          
          09:27:52
          there was no sound or movement in the night Frodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence he longed to shout out aloud hush whispered Strider what's that gasped Pippen at the same moment over the lip of the little Dell on the side away from the hill they felt rather than saw a shadow rise one Shadow or more than one they strained their eyes and the Shadows seemed to grow soon there could be no doubt three or four tall black Figures were standing there on the slope looking down on them so

          
          09:28:31
          black were they that they seemed like black holes in the Deep shade behind them Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as a venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill then the shape slowly Advanced Terror over came pipping and Merry and they threw themselves flat on the ground Sam shrank to Frodo's side Frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions he was quaking as if he was bitter cold but his Terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring the desire to do this laid hold of

          
          09:29:05
          him and he could think of nothing else he did not forget the bow nor the message of Gandalf but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings and he longed to yield not with a hope of Escape or of doing anything either good or bad he simply felt that he must take the ring and put it on his finger he could not speak he felt Sam looking at him as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble but he could not turn towards him he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but resistance became unbearable and at last

          
          09:29:42
          he slowly Drew out the chain and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left hand immediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark the shapes became terribly clear he was able to see beneath their black wrappings there were five tall figures two standing on the lip of the Dell three advancing in their white faces burned keen and merciless Eyes under their mantel were long gray robes upon their gray hairs were Helms of silver in their hagged hands were Swords of Steel their eyes fell on him and pierced him as they

          
          09:30:20
          rushed towards him desperate he drew his own sword and it seemed to him that it flickered red as if it was a Firebrand two of the figures halted the third was taller than the others his hair was long and gleaming and on his Helm was a crown in one hand he held a long sword and in the other a knife both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light he sprang forward and bore down on froo at that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground and he heard himself crying aloud oh elberth Gil thel

          
          09:30:56
          at the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy a shrill cry rang out in the night and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder even as he swooned he caught as through a swirling Mist a glimpse of Strider leaping out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand with a last effort Frodo dropping his sword slipped the ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it chapter 12 flight to the Ford when Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring

          
          09:31:37
          desperately he was lying by the fire which was now piled high and Burning Brightly his three companions were bending over him what has happened where is The Pale King he asked wildly they were too Overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while nor did they understand his question at length he gathered from Sam that they'd seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him

          
          09:32:13
          and he fell he heard Frodo's voice but it seemed to come from a great distance or from under the Earth crying out strange words they saw nothing more until they stumbled over the body of Frodo lying as if dead faced downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him Strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire and then he disappeared that was now a good while ago Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider but while they were talking he returned appearing suddenly Out of the

          
          09:32:50
          Shadows they started and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo but strien knelt down swiftly at his side I'm not a Black Rider Sam he said gently nor in League with them I've been trying to discover something of their movements but I've found nothing I can't think why they've gone and don't attack again but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand when he heard what Frodo had to tell he became full of concern and shook his head and sighed then he ordered Pippin and Mary to eat as much water as they could in

          
          09:33:29
          their small kettles and to bathe the wound with it keep the fire going well and keep Frodo warm he said then he got up and walked away and called Sam to him I think I understand things better now he said in a low voice there seem only to have been five of the enemy why they were not all here I don't know but I don't think they expected to be resisted they've drawn off for a time being but not far I fear they'll come back again another night if we can't escape but they're only waiting because they think that their purpose is almost

          
          09:34:10
          accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further I fear Sam that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their will we shall see Sam choked With Tears Don't despair said Strider you must trust me now your Frodo is made of Sterner stuff than I had guessed though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so he's not slain and I think he'll resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect I'll do all I can to help and heal him guard him well while I'm away he hurried off and disappeared

          
          09:34:50
          again into the darkness Frodo dozed though the pain of his wound was slowly growing and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side his friends watched over him warming him and bathing his wound the night passed slowly and wearily Dawn was growing in the sky and the Dell was filling with gray light when Strider at last returned look he cried and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had Lin there hidden by the darkness a foot above the lower hem there was a

          
          09:35:28
          slash this was the stroke of Frodo's sword he said the only hurt that it did to his enemy I fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pierce that Dreadful King more deadly to him was the name of elberth and more deadly to Frodo was this he stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife there was a cold gleam in it as strier raised it they saw that near the end its Edge was notched and the point was broken off but even as he held it up in the growing light they gazed in astonishment for the blade seemed to melt and

          
          09:36:10
          vanished like smoke in the air leaving only the hilt in strider's hand alas he cried it was this accursed knife that gave the wound few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons but I'll do what I can he sat down on the ground and taking the dagger Hilt laid it on his knees and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue then setting it aside he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others couldn't catch from the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a

          
          09:36:50
          plant these leaves he said I have walked far to find for this plant does not grow in the bare Hills but in the thickets away south of the road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves he crushed a leaf in his fingers and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance it is fortunate that I could find it for it's a healing plant that the men of the West brought to Middle Earth Aus they named it and it grows now sparely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old and it is not known in the north except to some of

          
          09:37:28
          those who wander in the wild it has great virtues but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small he threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo's shoulder the fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those that were unhe hurt felt their minds calmed and cleared the herb had also some power over the wound for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of Frozen cold lessen in his side but the life did not return to his arm and he could not raise or use his hand he bitterly regretted his

          
          09:38:06
          foolishness and reproached himself for weakness of will for he now perceived that in putting on the ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies he wondered if he would remain maimed for life and how they were would now managed to continue their Journey he felt too weak to stand the others were discussing this very question they quickly decided to leave weathertop as soon as possible I think now said Strider that the enemy has been watching this place for some days if Gandalf ever came here

          
          09:38:44
          then he must have been forced to ride away and he will not return in any case we're in great Peril here after dark since the attack of last night and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go as soon as the daylight was full they had some HED food and packed it was impossible for Frodo to walk so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them and put Frodo on the pony in the last few days the poor Beast had improved wonderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger and had begun

          
          09:39:20
          to show an affection for its new Masters especially for Sam Bill fernie's treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life they started off in a southerly direction this would mean crossing the road but it was the quickest way to more wooded country and they needed fuel for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm especially at night while fire would be some protection for them all it was also so his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another Great

          
          09:39:55
          Loop of the Road East Beyond weathertop it changed its course and took a wide Bend northwards they made their way slowly and cautiously round the southwestern slopes of the hill and came in a little while to the edge of the road there was no sign of the Riders but even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering trembling they sprang forward and made for the thickets that lay ahead the land before them sloped away southwards but it was wild

          
          09:40:30
          and pathless bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide ban spaces in between the grass was scanty coarse and gray and the leaves and the thickets were faded and falling it was a cheerless land and their Journey was slow and gloomy they spoke little as they trudged along Frodo's heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down and their backs bowed under their burdens even Strider seemed tired and heavy-hearted before the first day's March was over Frodo's pain began to grow again but he

          
          09:41:06
          did not speak of it for a long time 4 days passed without the ground or the scene changing much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer yet since that Far Cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them they dreaded the dark hours and kept watch in pairs By Night expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the gray night dimly lit by the cloud veiled moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but the

          
          09:41:41
          sigh of withered leaves and grass not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the Dell it seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their Trail again perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow place at the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide Shadow Valley into which they had descended Strider now turned their course again northeastwards and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow climbing

          
          09:42:15
          slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded Hills away below them they could see the road sweeping around the feet of the hills and to their right a gray River gleamed pale in the thin sunshine in the distance they glimpsed yet another River in a Stony Valley half veiled in Mist I'm afraid we must go back to the road here for a while said Strider we have now come to the river horwell that the elves call myel it flows down over the etan Moors the troll Fells north of rivendel and joins the loud water away in the South

          
          09:42:55
          some call it the gray flood after that it's a great water before it finds the sea there's no way over it below its sources in the Eon Moores except by the last bridge on which the road crosses what is that other River we can see far away there asked Mary that is loud water the breu and of rivendel answered Strider the road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the bridge to the Ford of bruan but I have not yet thought how we should cross the water One River at a time we shall be fortunate indeed if we

          
          09:43:34
          don't find the last bridge held against us next day early in the morning they came down again to the borders of the road Sam and Strider went forward but they found no sign of any Travelers or Riders here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain Strider judged that it had fallen 2 days before and had washed away all Footprints no Horsemen had passed since then as far as he could see they hurried along with all the speed they could make and after a mile or two they saw the last bridge ahead at

          
          09:44:09
          the bottom of a short steep slope they dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none Strider made them take cover in a Thicket at the side of the road while he went forward to explore before long he came hurrying back I can see no signs of the enemy he said and I wonder very much what that means but I found something very strange he held out his hand and showed a single pale green Jewel I found it in the mud in the middle of the bridge he said it is a baril an elf Stone whether it was set

          
          09:44:48
          there or let fall by chance I can't say but it brings hope to me I'll take it as a sign that we may pass the bridge but beyond that I dare not keep to the road without some clearer token at once they went on again they crossed the bridge in safety hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches a mile further on they came to a narrow Ravine that led away northwards through the Steep lands on the left of the road here Trier turned aside and soon they were lost in a somber country of dark trees winding

          
          09:45:27
          among the feet of suen Hills the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous road behind them but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly as they went forward the hills about them steadily Rose here and there upon Heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers they had an ominous look Frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ahead and to think he recalled Bilbo's account of his journey and the threatening Towers on the Hills North of the road in the

          
          09:46:03
          country near the trolls wood where his first serious Adventure had happened Frodo guessed that they were now in the same region and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot who lives in this land he asked and who built these towers is this TR country no said Strider trolls do not build no one lives in this land men once dwelt here ages ago but none remain now they became an evil people as Legends tell for they fell under the shadow of angmar but all were destroyed in the war that brought the north Kingdom to its

          
          09:46:42
          end but that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land where did you learn such Tales if all the land is empty and forgetful asked perigrine the birds and beasts don't tell Tales of that sort the Hees of elendil do not forget all these things said Strider and many more things than I can tell Remembered in rivendel have you often been to rivendel asked Frodo I have said Strider I dwelt there once and still I return When I may there my heart is but it is not my fate to sit

          
          09:47:23
          in peace even in the fair House of [Music] Eland the hills now began to shut them in the road behind held on its way to the river bruan but both were Now hidden from view The Travelers came into a Long Valley narrow deeply cloven dark and Silent trees with old and twisted Roots hung over Cliffs and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pinewood the hobbits grew very weary they Advanced slowly for they had to pick their way through a pathless country encumbered by Fallen trees and tumbled rocks as long as they could they avoided

          
          09:48:04
          climbing for Frodo's sake and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow Dales there had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet the wind began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant sea on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching Rain by Nightfall they were all soaked and their Camp was cheerless for they could not get any fire to burn the next day the hills Rose still higher and steeper before them and they were forced to turn away northwards

          
          09:48:39
          out of their course Strider seemed to be getting anxious they were nearly 10 days out from weathertop and their stock of Provisions was beginning to run low it went on raining that night they camped on a Stony Shelf with a rock wall behind them in which there was a shallow cave a mere scoop in the cliff Frodo was Restless the cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep he laid tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night noises

          
          09:49:17
          wind in chinks of rock water dripping a crack the sudden rattling fall of a loosened Stone he felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watching he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the sh but it seemed faint and dim less clear than the tall black Shadows that stood Looking Over the Hedge in in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped the clouds

          
          09:49:55
          were still thick but they were breaking and pale strips of blue appeared between them the wind was shifting again they didn't start early immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff until he came back he was going to climb up if he could and get a look at the LIE of the land when he he returned he wasn't reassuring we've come too far to the North he said and we must find some way to turn back southwards again if we keep

          
          09:50:31
          on as we are going we shall get up into the endal far north of rivendale that is troll country and little known to me we could perhaps find our way through and come round to rivendel from the north but it would take too long for I don't know the way and our food would not last so somehow or other we must find the Ford of bruan the rest of that day they spent scrambling over Rocky ground they found a passage between two Hills that led them into a valley running Southeast the direction that they wished to take

          
          09:51:05
          but towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land its dark Edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted soore they had a choice between going back or climbing over it they decided to attempt The Climb but it proved very difficult before long thodo was obliged to Dismount and struggle Along on foot even so they often despaired of getting their Pony up or indeed of finding a path for themselves burdened as they were the light was

          
          09:51:40
          nearly gone and they were all exhausted when at last they reached the top they had climbed onto a narrow saddle between two higher points and the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahead Frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering his left arm was lifeless and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them the trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim we can't go any further said Mery drider I'm afraid this has been too much for Frodo I'm dreadfully anxious about

          
          09:52:19
          him what are we to do do you think they'll be able to cure him in rivendel if we ever get there we shall see answered strer there is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness and it's chiefly because of his wound that I'm so anxious to press on but I agree that we can go no further tonight what's the matter with my master asked Sam in a low voice looking appealingly at Strider his womb was small and it's already closed there's nothing nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder Frodo's been touched by the

          
          09:52:56
          weapons of the enemy said Strider and there is some poison or evil at work that's beyond my skill to drive out but don't give up hope Sam night was cold up on the High Ridge they lit a small Fire Down Under the niled roots of an Old Pine that hung over a shallow pit it looked as if Stone had once been quarried there they sat h L together the wind blew chill through the pass and they heard the Treetops lower down moaning and sighing Frodo lay half in a dream imagining that endless Dark Wings were sweeping by above him

          
          09:53:35
          and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills the morning dawned bright and fair the air was clean and the light pale and clear in a rainwashed sky their hearts were encouraged but they longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs as soon as it was light Strider took Mary with him and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the pass the sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting news they were now going more or less in the

          
          09:54:10
          right direction if they went on down the further side of the ridge they would have the mountains on the left someway ahead Strider had caught a glimpse of the loud water again and he knew that though it was hidden from view the road to the Ford was not far from the river and lay on the side nearest to them we must make for the road again he said we can't hope to find a path through these Hills whatever danger May beset it the road is our only way to the Ford as soon as they had eaten they set out again they climbed slowly down the

          
          09:54:47
          southern side of the ridge but the way was much easier than they had expected for the slope was far less steep on this side and before long Frodo was able to ride again Bill fernie's poor old Pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path and for sparing its Rider as many jolts as possible the spirits of the party rose again even Frodo felt better in the morning light but every now and again a Mist seemed to obscure his sight and he passed his hands over his eyes pip was a little ahead of the

          
          09:55:21
          others suddenly he turned around and called to them there's a path here he cried when they came up with him they saw that he had made no mistake there were clearly the beginnings of a path that climbed with many windings Out of the Woods below and faded away on the hilltop behind in places it was now faint and overgrown or choked with Fallen stones and trees but at one time it seemed to have been much used it was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet here and there old trees had been cut or broken down and large rocks clov

          
          09:56:01
          or heaved aside to make a way they followed the track for some while for it offered much the easiest way down but they went cautiously and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods and the path grew plainer and broader suddenly coming out of a belt of fur trees it ran steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left around the corner of a rocky shoulder of the Hill when they came to the corner they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low Cliff overhung with

          
          09:56:36
          trees in the Stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly a jar upon one great [Music] hinge outside the door they all halted there was a cave or Rock chamber behind but in the Gloom inside nothing could be seen Strider Sam and Mary pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider and then Strider and Mary went in they didn't go far for on the floor lay many old bones and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots surely this is a troll hole if ever

          
          09:57:16
          there was one said Pippen come out you two and let us get away now we know who made the path and we better get off it quick there's no need I think said Strider coming out it's certainly a troll hole but it seems to have been long forsaken I don't think we need be afraid but let's go on down wearily and we shall see the path went on again from the door and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope Pippen not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid went on ahead with

          
          09:57:56
          Mary Sam and Strider came behind one on each side of Frodo's Pony for the path was now broad enough for four or five Hobbits to walk AB breast but they' not gone very far before Pippin came running back followed by Mary they both looked terrified there are trolls Pippen panted down in a clearing in the woods not far below we got a sight of them through the tree trunks they're very large we'll come and look at them said ster picking up a stick Frodo said nothing but Sam looked scared the sun was now high and had sha

          
          09:58:37
          down through the half stripped branches of the trees and lit the clearing with bright patches of light they halted suddenly on the edge and peered through the tree trunks holding their breath there stood the trolls three large trolls one was stooping and the other two stood staring at him Strider walked forward unconcernedly get up Old Stone he said and broke his stick upon the stooping troll nothing happened there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and then even Frodo laughed well he said

          
          09:59:15
          we're forgetting our family history these must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf quarreling over the right way to cook 13 dwarves in one Hobbit I had no idea we were anywhere near the place said Pippen he knew the story well Bilbo and Frodo had told it often but as a matter of fact he'd never more than half believed it even now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again you are forgetting not only your family history but all you ever knew

          
          09:59:50
          about trolls said Strider it's broad daylight with a bright sun and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this Glade in any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old bird's nest behind his ear that would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll they all laughed Frodo felt his spirits Reviving the reminder of Bilbo's first successful Adventure was hening the sun too was warm and comforting and the Mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a

          
          10:00:24
          little they rested for some time in the Glade and took their midday meal right under the shadow of the trolls large legs won't somebody give us a bit of a song while the sun is high said Mary when they'd finished we haven't had a song or a tale for days not since weathertop said Frodo the others looked at him don't worry about me he added I feel much better but I don't think I could sing perhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory come on Sam said Mary there's more stored in your head than you let on

          
          10:01:00
          about I don't know about that said Sam but how would this suit it ain't what I call proper poetry if you understand me just a bit of nonsense but these old images here brought it to my mind standing up with his hands behind his back as if he was at school he began to sing to an old tune troll sat alone on his seat of stone and munched and mumbled bare old bone for many a year he had gwed it near for meat was hard to come by D Bo gum boy in a cave in the Hills he dwelt alone and meat Wars hard to come by

          
          10:01:50
          up came Tom with his big boots on said e to troll pray what is he on for it looks like the shin of my Uncle Tim as should be a lion in graveyard cavey pave yard this many a year has Tim been gone and I thought he was lying in graveyard my lad says troll this bone I stole but what be bones that that lie in a hole thy unle was dead as a lump Le a I found his shin bone thin bone thin bone he can spare a share for a poor old troll for he don't need his shin bone said Tom I don't see why the likes of thee without ax and leave should go

          
          10:02:47
          make in free or the shank or the ship of my father's King so Hand the old bone over R Trover though dad be it belongs to he so Hand the old bone over for a couple of pins says Troll and grins i' eat thee too and nor thy shins a bit of fresh meat will go down sweet I'll try my teeth on thee now he now see now I'm tired and Nord andal bones and skins I a mind to D on thee now but just as he thought his dinner was caught he found his hands had hold of not for before he could mind Tom slipped behind and gave him the boot to

          
          10:03:45
          learn him warn him darn him AB but the boot on the seat Tom thought would be the way to learn him but harder than stone is the Flesh and bone of a troll that sits in the Hills alone as well set your boot to the Mountain's route for the seat of a troll don't feel it peel it he it old troll laughed when he heard Tom groan and he knew his toes could feel it Tom's leg is game since home he came and his bootless foot is lasting lame but troll don't care and he's still there with the bone he boned from its

          
          10:04:37
          owner Doner boner TR old seat is still the same and the Bony bone from its owner well that's a warning to us all laughed Mary it's as well you used a stick and not your hand Strider where did you come by that Sam asked Pippin I've never heard those words before Sam muttered something inaudible it's out of his own head of course said Frodo I'm learning a lot about Sam gamji on this journey first he was a conspirator now he's a Jester he'll end up by becoming a wizard or for a warrior I hope not said Sam I don't

          
          10:05:24
          want to be neither in the afternoon they went on down the woods they were probably following the very track that Gandalf Bilbo and the dwarves had used many years before after a few miles they came out on the top of a high Bank above the road at this point the road had left the whewell far behind in its narrow Valley and now clung close to the feet of the Hills rolling and winding Eastward among the woods and Heather covered slopes towards the Fords and the mountains not far down the bank Strider pointed out a

          
          10:05:59
          stone in the grass on it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf runs and secret marks there said Mary that must be the stone that marked the place where the Troll's gold was hidden how much is left of Bilbo share I wonder Frodo Frodo looked at the stone and wished that Bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous nor less easy to part with none at all he said Bilbo gave it all away he told me he didn't feel it was really his as it came from robbers the road laid quiet under the

          
          10:06:38
          Long Shadows of early evening there was no sign of any other travelers to be seen as there was now no other possible course for them to take they climbed down the bank and turning left left went off as fast as they could soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering Sun a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead they were beginning to look out for a place off the road where they could camp for the night when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back

          
          10:07:11
          into their hearts the noise of hoofs behind them they looked back but they couldn't see far because of the many windings and Rollings of the road as quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep Heather and bilbury Brushwood on the slopes above until they came to a small patch of thick growing Hazels as they peered out from among the bushes they could see the road faint and Gray in the failing light some 30 ft below them the sound of hoofs grew nearer they were going fast with a light

          
          10:07:45
          clippity clippity clip then faintly as if it was blown away from the by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing as of small bells tinkling that doesn't sound like a black Rider's horse said Frodo listening intently the other Hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but they all remained full of Suspicion they'd been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly but Strider was now leaning forward stooped to the ground with a hand to his ear and a look of Joy on his

          
          10:08:20
          face the light faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly clearer and nearer now the bells jingled and clippy clip came the quick trotting feet suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows running swiftly in the dusk its head stall flickered and flashed as if it were studded with gems like living Stars the rider's cloak streamed behind him and his hood was thrown back his Golden Hair flowed shimmering in the Wind of his speed to Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and

          
          10:08:55
          rment of the rider as if through a thin veil Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road leaping with a cry through the Heather but even before he had moved or called the rider had rained in his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood when he saw Strider he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out I now his speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts the Riders of the Elven folk no others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to

          
          10:09:34
          hear but they seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider soon Strider beckoned to them and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried down to the road this is glor findle who dwells in the house of elrond said Strider hail and well met at last said the elf Lord to Frodo I was sent from rivendel to look for you we feared that you were in danger upon the road then Gandalf has reached rivendel cried Frodo joyfully no he had not when I departed

          
          10:10:13
          but that was 9 days ago answered glorfindel elron received news that troubled him some of my Kindred journeying in your land beyond the barand dwin which you call the Brandywine River learned that things were a miss and sent messages as swiftly as they could they said that the nine were abroad and that you were as stray bearing a great burden without guidance for Gandalf had not returned there are few even in rivendel that can ride openly against the nine but such as they were Elon sent out north west and south

          
          10:10:50
          it was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid Pursuit and become lost in the wilderness it was my lot to take the road and I came to the bridge of methel and left a token there NY on 7even days ago three of the Servants of saon were upon the bridge but they withdrew and I pursued them Westward I came also upon two others but they turned away Southward since then I've searched for your Trail two days ago I found it and followed it over the bridge and today I marked where you descended from the hills again but come there is

          
          10:11:26
          no time for further news since you are here we must risk the Peril of the road and go there are five behind us and when they find your Trail upon the road they will ride after us like the wind and they are not all where the other four may be I do not know I fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us while glor findle was speaking the shades of evening deep happed Frodo felt a great weariness come over him ever since the sun began to sink the Mist before his eyes had darkened and he felt

          
          10:11:59
          that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends now pain assailed him and he felt cold he swayed clutching at Sam's arm my master is sick and wounded said Sam angrily he can't go on riding after Nightfall he needs rest glor findle caught Frodo as he sank to the ground and taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety briefly Strider told of the attack on their Camp under weathertop and of the deadly knife he drew out the hilt which he had kept and handed it to

          
          10:12:35
          the elf glorfindel shuted as he took it but he looked intently at it there are evil things written on this Hilt he said though maybe your eyes cannot see them keep it Aragorn till we reach the House of Elon but be wary and handle it as little as you may alas the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal I will do what I can but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest he searched the wound on Frodo's shoulder with his fingers and his face grew Graver as if what he learned disquieted

          
          10:13:11
          him but Frodo felt the chill lesson in his side and arm a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand the pain grew easier The Dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him as if a cloud had been withdrawn he saw his friends faces more clearly again and a measure of New Hope and strength returned you shall ride my horse said glorfindel I will shorten the stups up to the saddle skirts and you must sit as tight as you can but you need not fear my horse will not let any Rider fall that I command him to bear his pace is

          
          10:13:49
          light and smooth and if danger presses too near he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival no he will not said Frodo I shall not ride him if I'm to be carried off to rivendel or anywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger glorfindel smiled I doubt very much he said if your friends would be in danger if you were not with them the B would follow you and leave us in peace I think it is you Frodo and that which you bear that brings us all in Peril to that Frodo had no answer and he

          
          10:14:25
          was persuaded to mount glorfindel's White Horse the pony was Laden instead with a great part of the others burdens so that they now marched lighter and for a Time made good speed but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the Swift tireless feet of The Elf on he led them into the mouth of darkness and still on under the Deep clouded night there was nether star nor Moon not until the gray of dawn did he allow them to Halt Pippin Mary and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling

          
          10:14:59
          legs and even Strider seemed by the SAG of his shoulders to be weary Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream they cast themselves down in the Heather a few yards from the roadside and fell asleep immediately they seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when glorfindel who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again the sun had now climbed far into the morning and the clouds and Mists of the night were gone drink this said gfle to them pouring for each in turn a little liquor from his silver studded flask of leather

          
          10:15:36
          it was clear as spring water and had no taste and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth but strength and vigor seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it eaten after that draft the stale bread and dried fruit which was now all they had left seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the sh had done they had rested rather less than 5 hours when they took to the road again glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brief halts during the day's

          
          10:16:12
          March in this way they covered almost 20 miles before nightfall and came to a point where the road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the Valley now making straight for the Bruin in so far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear but often glor findle would Halt and listen for a moment if they lagged behind and a look of anxiety clouded his face once or twice he spoke to Strider in the elf tongue but however anxious their guides might be it was plain that the hobbits

          
          10:16:46
          could go no further that night there were stumbling along dizzy with weariness and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs Frodo's pain had redoubled and during the day things about him faded to Shadows of ghostly gray he almost welcomed the coming of night for then the world seemed less pale and empty the hobbits were still weary when they set out again early next morning there were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace Pace they could

          
          10:17:20
          manage our Peril will be greatest just a we reach the river said glorfindel for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now Swift behind us and other danger may be waiting by the Ford the road was still running steadily downhill and there was now in places much grass at either side in which the hobbits walked when they could to ease their tired feet in the late afternoon they came to a place where the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red

          
          10:17:54
          stone Echo ran along as they huded forward and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own all at once as if through a gate of light the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open there at the bottom of a Sharp incline they saw before them a long flat Mile and beyond that the Ford of rivendel on the third F side was a steep Brown Bank threaded by a winding path and behind that the tall mountains climbed shoulder above shoulder and Peak Beyond Peak into the fading

          
          10:18:32
          Sky there was still an echo as a following feet in The Cutting behind them a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the Pines one moment lle turned and listened then he sprang forward with a loud cry fly fly he called fly the enemy is upon us the White Horse leapt forward the hobbits ran down the slope glor findle and Strider followed his rear guard they were only halfway across the flat when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping out of the gate in the

          
          10:19:07
          trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider he rained his horse in and halted swaying in his saddle another followed him and then another then again two more ride forward ride cried glorfindel to Frodo he did not obey at once for a strange reluctance seized him checking the horse to a walk he turned and looked back the Riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill dark and solid while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a Mist suddenly he

          
          10:19:44
          knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait then at once once fear and hatred awoke in him his hand left the bridal and gripped the hilt of his sword and with a red flash he drew it ride on ride on cried glorfindel and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elf tongue norim nor at once the White Horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road at the same moment the black horses leapt down the hill in Pursuit and from the riders came a terrible cry such as Frodo had heard

          
          10:20:21
          filling the woods with horror in the East faring far away it was answered and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other riders came flying two rode towards Frodo two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his Escape they seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker as their courses converged with his Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder he could no longer see his friends the Riders behind were falling

          
          10:20:53
          back even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf horse of glorfindel he looked forward again and hope faded there seemed no chance of reaching the Ford before he was cut off by the others that had laay in Ambush he could see them clearly now they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were robed in white and gray swords were naked in their pale hands Helms were on their heads their cold eyes glittered and they called to him with fell voices fear now filled all

          
          10:21:25
          Frodo's mind he thought no longer of his sword No Cry came from him he shut his eyes and clung to the horse's man the wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill a breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear as with the last spurt like a flash of white fire the elf horse speeding as if on wings passed right right before the face of the foremost Rider Frodo heard the splash of water it foamed about his feet he felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the

          
          10:21:58
          river and struggled up the Stony path he was climbing the Steep Bank he was across the Ford but the pursuers were close behind at the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about nighing fiercely there were nine Riders at the water's edge below and Frodo's spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifting faces he knew of nothing that would prevent them from Crossing as easily as he had done and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of rivendel if

          
          10:22:31
          once the Riders crossed in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to Halt hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward it checked at the water and reared up with a great effort Frodo sat upright and brandished his sword go back he cried go back to the land of moror and follow me no more his voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears the Riders halted but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil his enemies laughed at him with

          
          10:23:08
          a harsh and chilling laughter come back come back they called to Mordor we will take you go back he whisper but the Ring The Ring they cried with deadly voices and immediately their leader urged his horse forward into the water followed closely by two others by elberth and luthan the fair said froda with a last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither the ring nor me then the leader who was now half across the Ford stood up menacing in his stups and raised up his hand thodo was stricken

          
          10:23:48
          dumb he felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart laboring his sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand the elf horse reared and snorted the foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing a noise of loud Waters Rolling many stones dimly froa saw the river below him rise and down along its course there came a plumed Cavalry of waves white Flames seemed to froo to flick on their crests and he half fancied that he saw amid the water

          
          10:24:22
          white Riders upon white horses with frothing maidens the three riders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed they disappeared bedded suddenly under angry foam those that were behind Drew back into his May with his last failing senses Frodo heard cries and it seemed to him that he saw beyond the riders that hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white light and behind it ran small sh shadowy forms waving Flames that flared red in the gray Mist that was falling over the world the black horses were filled with

          
          10:24:56
          Madness and leaping forward in Terror they bore their Riders into the rushing flood their piercing cries were drowned in the Roaring of the river as it carried them away then Frodo felt himself falling and the Roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemies he heard and saw no more book two chapter 1 many meetings Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed at first he thought that he had slept late after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory or perhaps he'd been ill but the

          
          10:25:43
          ceiling looked strange it was flat and it had dark beams richly carved he lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall where am I and what's the time he said aloud to the ceiling in the house of Elon and it is 10:00 in the morning said a voice it is the morning of October the 24th if you want to know Gandalf cried Frodo sitting up there was the old wizard sitting in a chair by the open window yes he said I am here and you're lucky to be here too after all the

          
          10:26:27
          absurd things you've done since you left home Frodo lay down again he felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue and in any case he didn't think he would get the better of an argument he was fully awake now and the memory of his journey was returning the disastrous shortcut through the Old Forest the accident the prancing pony and his Madness in putting on the ring in the Dell and weathertop while he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in rendel

          
          10:27:00
          there was a long silence broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf's pipe as he blew white smoke rings out of the window where's Sam Frodo asked at length and are the others all right yes they are all safe and sound said Gandalf Sam was here until I sent him off to get some rest about half an hour ago what happened at the Ford said Frodo it all seemed so dim somehow and it still does yes it would you were beginning to fade answered Gandalf the wound was overcoming you at last a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid

          
          10:27:43
          but you have some strength in you my dear Hobbit as you showed in the barow that was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous moment of all I wish you could have held out at weathertop you seem to know a great deal already said Frodo I have not spoken to the others about the batt at first it was too horrible and afterwards there were other things to think about how do you know about it you have talked long in your sleep Frodo said Gandalf gently and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory don't worry though

          
          10:28:22
          I said absurd just now I didn't mean it I think well of you and of the others it's no small feat to have come so far and through such dangers still bearing the ring we should never have done it without Strider said Frodo but we needed you I didn't know what to do without you I was delayed said Gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin and yet I'm not sure it may have been better so I wish you'd tell me what happened all in good time you're not supposed to talk or worry about anything today by elon's

          
          10:29:02
          orders but talking would stop me thinking and wondering which are quite as tiring said Frodo I'm wide awake now and I remember so many things that want explaining why were you delayed you ought to tell me that at least you will soon hear all you wish to know said Gandalf we shall have a council as soon as you are well enough at the moment I will only say that I was held captive you cried Frodo yes I Gandalf the Gray said the wizard solemnly there are many powers in the world for good or for evil

          
          10:29:39
          some are greater than I am against some I have not yet been measured but my time is coming the more oral Lord and his Black Riders have come forth war is preparing then you knew of the Riders already before I met them yes I knew of them indeed I spoke of them once to you for the Black Riders of the Ring raids the nine Servants of The Lord of the Rings but I did not know that they had Arisen again or I should have fled with you at once I heard news of them only after I left you in June but that story must

          
          10:30:19
          for the moment we have been saved from Disaster by Aragon yes said Frodo it was Strider that saved us yet I was afraid of him at first Sam never quite trusted him I think not at any rate until we met glor findle gandal smiled I have heard all about Sam he said he has no more doubts now I'm glad said Frodo for I've become very fond of Strider well fond is not the right word I mean he's dear to me though he's strange and Grim at times in fact he reminds me often of you I didn't know that any of the big people were like that I thought

          
          10:31:03
          well that they were just big and rather stupid kind of stupid like butur or stupid and wicked like Bill Fernie but then we don't know much about men in the Sha except perhaps the bre Landers you don't know very much even about them if you think old bman is stupid said Gandalf he's wise enough on his own ground he thinks less than he talks and slower yet he can see through a brick wall in time as they say in Brie but there are few left in Middle Earth like Aragorn son of arthorn the race of the Kings from Over the Sea is nearly at an

          
          10:31:42
          end it may be that this war of the Ring will be their last adventure do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the Old Kings said Frodo in wonder I thought they had all vanished long ago I thought he was only a Ranger only a ranger cried Gandalf my dear Frodo that's just what the Rangers are The Last Remnant in the north of the great people the men of the West they have helped me before and I shall need their help in the days to come for we have reached rivendel but the ring is not yet at rest I suppose

          
          10:32:20
          not said Frodo but so far my only thought has been to get here and I hope I sh have to go any further it's very pleasant just to rest I have had a month of Exile and adventure and I find that has been as much as I want he fell silent and shut his eyes after a while he spoke again I've been Reckoning he said and I can't bring the total up to October the 24th it ought to be the 21st we must have reached the Ford by the 20th you've talked and reckoned more than is good for you said Gandalf how do the side and shoulder

          
          10:33:00
          feel now I don't know Frodo answered they don't feel at all which is an improvement but he made an effort I can move my arm again a little yes it's coming back to life it's not cold he added touching his left hand with his right good said Gandalf it's mending fast you'll soon be sound again elron has cured you he has tendered you for days ever since you were brought in days said Frodo well four nights and three days to be exact the elves brought you from the Ford on the night of the 20th and that's

          
          10:33:41
          where you lost count we've been terribly anxious and Sam has hardly left your side day or night except SE to run messages Elon is a master of healing but the weapons of our enemy are deadly to tell you the truth I had very little hope for I suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound but it could not be found until last night then Elon removed a splinter it was deeply buried and it was working inwards Frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had

          
          10:34:18
          vanished in strider's hands don't be alarmed said Gandalf it's gone now it has been melted and it seems that Hobbits fade very reluctantly I have known strong Warriors of the big people who would quickly have been overcome by that splitter which you bore for 17 days what would they have done to me asked Frodo what were the Riders trying to do they tried to pierce your heart with a morgal knife which remains in the wound if they had succeeded you would have become like they are only weaker and under their command you would have

          
          10:34:56
          become a wraith under the Dominion of the dark lord and he would have tormented you for trying to keep his ring if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand thank goodness I didn't realize the horrible danger said Frodo faintly I was mortally afraid of course but if I had known more I should not have dared even to move it's a Marvel that I escaped yes fortune or fate have helped you said Gandalf not to mention courage for your heart was not touched and only

          
          10:35:32
          your shoulder was pierced and that was because you resisted to the last but it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak you were in gravest Peril while you wore the ring for then you are half in The Wraith World yourself and they might have seized you you could see them and they could see you I know said Frodo they were terrible to behold but why could we all see their horses because they are real horses just as the black robes are real robes that they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with

          
          10:36:06
          a living then why do these black horses endure such Riders all other animals are terrified when they draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel the dogs howl and the GE scream at them because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord in Mordor not all his servants and chattles are wths there are Orcs And TRS there are ws and werewolves and there have been and still are many men Warriors and kings that walk alive Under the Sun and yet are under his Sway and their number is growing

          
          10:36:43
          daily what about rivendel and the elves is rivendel safe yes at present until all else is conquered the elves May fear the dark lord and they may fly before him but never again will they listen to him or serve him and here in rivendel there live still some of his chief foes the Elven wise Lords of the Eldar from Beyond the furthest Seas they do not fear the ring bra for those who have dwelt in the Blessed realm live at once in both worlds and against both the scene and the the Unseen they have great

          
          10:37:20
          power I thought that I saw a white figure that Shawn and did not grow dim like the others was that glorfindel then yes you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side one of the mighty of the first born he is an elf Lord of a house of princes indeed there is a power in rivendel to withstand the might of Mordor for a while and elsewhere other powers still dwell there is power to of another kind in the sh but all such places will soon become Islands Under Siege if things go on as they are going

          
          10:37:57
          the dark lord is putting forth all his strength still he said standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire we must keep up our courage you'll soon be well if I don't talk you to death you're in rivendale and you need not worry about anything for the present I haven't any courage to keep up said Frodo but I'm not worried at the moment just give me news of my friends and tell me the end of the affair at the Ford as I keep on asking and I shall be

          
          10:38:34
          content for the present after that I shall have another sleep I think but I Shan be able to close my eyes until you finish the story for me gandal moved his chair to the bedside and took a good look at Frodo the color had come back to his face and his eyes were clear and fully awake and aware he was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him but to the wizard's eye there was a faint change just a hint as if it were of transparency about him and especially about the left hand that lay outside

          
          10:39:08
          upon the CET still that must be expected said Gandalf to himself he's not half through yet to what he will come in the end not even Elon can forell not to evil I think he may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can you look Splendid he said aloud I'll risk a brief tale without consulting Eland but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again this is what happened as far as I can gather the ride is made straight for you as soon as you fled they didn't need the guidance of their

          
          10:39:49
          horses any longer you had to become visible to them being already on the threshold of their world and also the ring drew them near your friends sprang aside off the road or they would have been ridden down they knew that nothing could save you if the White Horse could not the Riders were too Swift to overtake and too many to oppose on foot even glor findle and Aragorn together could not withstand all the nine at one when the ring raid swept by your friends ran up behind close to the Ford there's

          
          10:40:24
          a small Hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees there they hastely Kindle far for glor findle knew that a flood would come down if the Riders tried to cross and then he would have to deal with any of them that were left on his side of the river the moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by Aragon and the others with flaming Brands caught between fire and water and seeing an elf Lord revealed in his wroth they were dism made and their horses were stricken with Madness three were

          
          10:40:56
          Carried Away by the first assault of the flood the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed and is that the end of the Black Riders asked Frodo no said Gandalf their horses must have perished and without them they are crippled but the ring raids themselves cannot be so easily destroyed however there's nothing more to fear from them at present your friends crossed After the flood had passed and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank with a broken sword

          
          10:41:30
          under you the horse was standing guard beside you you were pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or Worse El Ron's folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendel who made the flood asked Frodo elron commanded it answered Gandalf the river of this Valley is under his power and it will rise in Anger when he has great need to Bar the Ford as soon as the captain of the Ring raids rode into the water the flood was released if I may say so I added a few touches of my own you may not have noticed but some of

          
          10:42:10
          the Waves took the form of great white horses with shining white Riders and there were many rolling and grinding boulders for a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too Fierce a Roth and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away there is great Vigor in the waters that come down from the Snows of the Misty Mountains yes it all comes back to me now said Frodo the tremendous roaring I thought I was drowning with my friends and enemies and all but now we're safe Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo but he

          
          10:42:45
          had shut his eyes yes you're all safe for the present soon there will be feasting and merry making to celebrate the victory at the Ford of bruan and you will all be there in places of Honor Splendid said Frodo it's wonderful that elrond and glorfindel and such great Lords not to mention Strider should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness well there are many reasons why they should said gandal smiling I am one good reason the ring is another you are the ring bearer and you are the heir of

          
          10:43:22
          Bilbo the ring finder dear Bilbo said Frodo sleepily I wonder where he is I wish he was here and could hear all about it it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over the moon and the poor old troll with that he fell asleep Frodo was now safe in the last homely House East of the C that house was as Bilbo had long ago reported a perfect house whether you like food or sleep or storytelling or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a pleasant mixture of them all merely to be there was a cure for

          
          10:44:05
          weirdness fear and sadness as the evening Drew on froo woke up again and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep but had a mind for food and drink and probably for singing and storytelling afterwards he got out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been he found laid Ready Clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered it looked remarkably like the young

          
          10:44:42
          nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the shower but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully yes you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a Looking Glass he said to his reflection but now for a merry meeting he stretched out his arms and whistled a tune at that moment there was a knock on the door and Sam came in he ran to Frodo and took his left hand awkwardly and shyly he stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away hello Sam said Frodo it's warm said Sam

          
          10:45:19
          meaning your hand Mr Frodo it has felt so cold through the long nights but glory and trumpets he cried turning around again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor it's fine to see you up and yourself again sir gandaf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down and I thought he was joking I'm ready said Frodo let's go and look for the rest of the party I can take it to them sir said Sam it's a big house this and very peculiar always a bit more to discover and no knowing what you'll find around the corner and elves

          
          10:45:56
          sir elves here and elves there some like kings terrible and Splendid and some as maran's children and the music and the singing not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here but I'm getting to know some of the ways of the place I know what you've been doing Sam said Frodo taking his arm but you shall be merry tonight and listen to your heart's content come on guide me around the corners Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high Garden above the Steep Bank

          
          10:46:32
          of the river he found his friend sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking East Shadows had fallen in the valley below but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far above the air was warm the sound of running and falling water was loud and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers as if summer still lingered in elon's gardens hooray cried Pippen springing up here is our Noble cousin Make Way for Frodo Lord of the Ring hush said gandal from the Shadows of the back of the

          
          10:47:07
          porch evil things do not come into this Valley but all the same we should not name them the lord of the ring is not Frodo but the master of the dark Tower of Mordor whose power is again stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fortress outside it is getting dark Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that said Pippen he thinks I need keeping an order but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in this place I feel I could sing if I knew the right song for the

          
          10:47:43
          occasion I feel like singing myself laughed Frodo though at the moment I feel more like eating and drinking that will soon be cured said Pippen you've shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal more than a meal a feast said Mary as soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered the preparations began he'd hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many Bells the Hall of elon's house was filled with Holk elves for the most part though there were a few guests of other

          
          10:48:20
          sorts Elrod as was his custom sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the Das and next to him on the one side sat gindel on the other side sat Gandalf Frodo looked at them in Wonder for he had never before seen Elon of whom so many tales spoke and as they sat upon his right hand and his left glorfindel and even Gandalf whom he thought in knew so well were revealed as Lords of dignity and power Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two but his long white hair his sweeping silver beard and his

          
          10:48:59
          broad shoulders made him look like some wise king of ancient legend in his aged face under great Snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into far glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shining gold his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy his eyes were bright and keen and his voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in his hand was strength the face of Elon was ageless neither old nor young though in it was written the memory of many things both

          
          10:49:38
          glad and sorrowful his hair was dark as the shadows of Twilight and upon it was set a circlet of silver his eyes were gray as a clear evening and in them was a light like the light of stars venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many Winters and yet hail is a tried warrior in the fullness of his strength he was the Lord of rivendel and mighty among both elves and men in the middle of the table against the woven cloths upon the wall there was a chair under a canopy and there sat a lady fair to look upon and so like was

          
          10:50:16
          she in form of Womanhood to elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his close Kindred young she was and yet not so the braids of her dark hair were touched by No frost her white arms and clear face were Flawless and smooth and the light of stars was in her Bright Eyes gray as a cloudless night yet queenly she looked and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of one who has known many things that the years bring above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems glittering white but her

          
          10:50:52
          soft gray rment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver so it was that Frodo saw her whom few Mortals had yet seen aen daughter of Elon in whom it was said that the likeness of luian had come on Earth again and she was called unel for she was the even star of her people long she had been in the land of her mother's kin in lauan beyond the mountains and was but lately returned to rivendel to her father's house but her brothers El Adan and El rooh here were out upon entry for they rode often far a field with the

          
          10:51:34
          Rangers of the north forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the Orcs such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind and he was both surprised and The Bash to find that he had a seat at elon's table among all these folk so high and fair though he had a suitable chair and was raised upon several cushions he felt very small and rather out of place but that feeling quickly passed the feast was Mery and the food all that his hunger could desire it was

          
          10:52:07
          some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbors he looked first for his friends L had begged to be allowed to wait on his master but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honor Frodo could see him now sitting with Pippen and Mary at the upper end of one of the side tables close to the Des he could see no sign of Strider next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance richly dressed his beard very long and forked was white nearly as white as the snow

          
          10:52:44
          white cloth of his garments he he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds froda stopped eating to look at him welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him then he actually Rose from his seat and bowed glowing At Your Service he said and bowed still lower Frodo bgin at your service and your families said Frodo correctly rising in Surprise and scattering his cushions am I right in guessing that you are the Glo one of the 12 Companions of the great Thorin Oaken Shield quite

          
          10:53:24
          right answered the dwarf Gathering up the cushions and courteously assisting Frodo back into his seat and I do not ask for I have already been told that you are the Kinsman and adopted heir of our friend Bilbo the renowned allow me to congratulate you on your recovery thank you very much said Frodo you have had some very strange Adventures I hear said gloin I wonder greatly what brings four Hobbits on so long a journey nothing like it has happened since bluebo came with us but perhaps I should not inquire too closely since elron and

          
          10:54:04
          Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this I think we will not speak of it at least not yet said Frodo politely he guessed that even in elon's house the matter of the was not one for casual talk and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time but I am equally curious he added to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain gloin looked at him if you have not heard I think we will not speak yet of that either Master Elon will summon us long I believe and then we shall all

          
          10:54:42
          hear many things but there is much else that may be told throughout the rest of the meal they talked together but Frodo listened more than he spoke for the news of the Sha apart from The Ring seemed small and far away and unimportant while gloin had much to tell of events in the northern regions of wilderland Frodo learned that Grim bejor the old son of bjor was now the Lord of many sturdy men and to their land between the mountains and merkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go indeed said gloin if it were not for the

          
          10:55:21
          Bings the passage from Dale to rivendel would long ago become impossible they are Valiant men and keep open the high pass on the fort of kok but their tolls are high he added with a shake of his head and like beor of old they are not over fond of dwarves still they are trusty and that is much in these days nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of Dale they are good folk the Bings the grandson of Bard The Bowman rules them brand son of Bane son of Bard he is a strong King and his

          
          10:56:00
          realm now reaches far south and east of esgaroth and what of your own people asked Frodo there is much to tell good and bad said glin yet it is mostly good we have so far been fortunate though we do not escape the shadow of these times if you really wish to hear of us I will tell you Tidings gladly but stop me when you're weary dwarves tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork they say and with that gloin embarked on a long account of the doings of the dwarf Kingdom he was delighted to have found

          
          10:56:37
          so polite a listener for Frodo showed no signs of weirdness and made no attempt to change the subject though actually he soon got rather lost among strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before he was interested however to hear that D was still King onto the mountain and was now old having passed his 250th year venerable and fabulously Rich of the 10 companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were still with him dwalin gloin Dory Nori Baer bofer and bomber bomber was now so fat that he

          
          10:57:20
          could not move himself from his couch to his chair table and it took six young dwarves to lift him and what has become of barlin and Ai and O asked Frodo a shadow passed over glo's face we do not know he answered it is largely on account of barin that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivendale but tonight let us speak of merer things glin began then to talk of the works of his people telling Frodo about their great labors in Dale and Under the Mountain we have done well he said but in metal work we cannot rival

          
          10:58:00
          our fathers many of who secrets are lost we make good armor and Keen swords but we cannot again make male or bade to match those that were made before the dragon came only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days you should see the waterways of Dale Frodo and The Fountains and the pools you should see the stone paved roads of Many Colors and the halls and cavernous streets under the Earth with archers carved like trees and The Terraces and Towers upon the mountain sides then you would see that we have not been

          
          10:58:37
          idle I will come and see them if I can said Frodo how surprised Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the desolation of smog gloin looked at Frodo and smiled you were very fond of Bilbo were you not he asked yes answered Frodo I'd rather see him than all the towers and palaces in the world at length the feast came to an end elrond and Arwin Rose and went down the hall and the company followed them in due order the doors were thrown open and they went across a wide passage and through other doors and came into a

          
          10:59:16
          further Hall Hall in it were no tables but a bright fire was burning in a great Hearth between the Caren pillars upon either side Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf this is the Hall of fire said the wizard here you will hear many songs and tales if you can keep awake but except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet and people come here who wish for peace and thought there's always a fire here all the year round but there's little other light as Elon entered and went towards the seat prepared for him Elvish

          
          10:59:53
          minstrels began to make sweet music slowly the hall filled and Frodo looked with delight upon the many Fair faces that were gathered together the golden fire light played upon them and shimmered in their hair suddenly he noticed not far from the further end of the fire a small dark figure Seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar beside him on the ground was a drinking cup and some bread Frodo wondered whether he was Ill if people were ever ill in rivendel and had been unable to come to the feast his head

          
          11:00:28
          seemed sunk in sleep on his breast and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face elron went forward and Stood Beside the silent figure awake little Master he said with a smile then turning to Frodo he beckoned to him now at at last the hour has come that you've wished for Frodo he said here's a friend that you've long missed the dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face Bilbo cried Frodo with sudden recognition and he sprang forward hello Frodo my lad said Bilbo so you've got here at last I hoped you'd

          
          11:01:11
          manage it well well so all this feasting is in your honor I hear I hope you enjoyed it why weren't you there cried Frodo and why haven't I been allowed to see you before because you were asleep I've seen a good deal of you I've sat by your side with Sam each day but as for the feast I don't go in for such things much now and I had something else to do what were we doing why sitting and thinking I do a lot of that nowadays and this is the best place to do it in as a rule wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at Elon

          
          11:01:51
          there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that Frodo could see wake up I was not asleep Master Elon if you want to know you've all come out from your feast too soon and you've Disturbed me in the middle of making up a song I was stuck over a line or two and was thinking about them but now I don't suppose I shall ever get them right there'll be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven clean out of my head I shall have to get my friend the dunadan to help me where is he Elon

          
          11:02:26
          laughed he shall be found he said then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task and we will hear it and judge it before we end our merry makings Messengers were sent to find Bilbo's friend though none knew where he was or why he hadn't been present at the feast in the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side and Sam came quickly and placed himself near them they talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about them Bilbo had not much to say of himself

          
          11:03:02
          when he'd left hobbiton he'd wandered off aimlessly along the road or in the country on either side but somehow he had steered all the time towards rivendel I got here without much Adventure he said and after rest I went on with the dwarves to Dale my last journey I sh travel again old bar and had gone away then I came back here and here I've been I've done this and that I've written some more of my book and of course I make up a few songs they sing them occasionally just to please me I think for of course they aren't really

          
          11:03:41
          good enough for rivendel and I listen and I think time doesn't seem to pass here it just is a remarkable place all together I hear all kinds of news from over the mountains and out of the South but hardly anything from the far I heard about the ring of course Gandalf has not been here often not that he's told me a great deal he's become closer than ever these last few years the dunadan has told me more fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance it's a Pity that Gandalf didn't find out more sooner I could have brought the

          
          11:04:22
          thing here myself long ago without so much trouble I thought several times of going back to hobbiton for it but I'm getting old and they would not let me gandal and elron I mean they seemed to think that the enemy was looking high and low for me and would make mince meat of me if he caught me taring about in the wild and Gandalf said the ring is passed on Bilbo it would do no good to you or to others if you tried to mdle with it again OD sort of remark just like Gandalf but he said he was looking

          
          11:04:56
          after you so I let things be I'm frightfully glad to see you safe and sound he paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully have you got it here he asked in a whisper I can't help feeling curious you know after all I've heard I should very much like just to peep at it again yes I've got it answered Frodo feeling a strange reluctance it looks just the same as ever it did well I should just like to see it for a moment said Bilbo when he dressed Frodo found that while he slept the ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain light but

          
          11:05:38
          strong slowly he drew it out Bilbo put out his hand but Frodo quickly Drew back the ring to his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at billbo a shadow seemed to have fallen between them and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands he felt a desire to strike him the music and singing around them seemed to falter and the silence fell Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes I understand now he said put it away I'm

          
          11:06:16
          sorry sorry you've come in for this burden sorry about everything don't Adventures ever have an end I suppose not someone else always has to carry on the story Well it can't be helped I wonder if it's any good trying to finish my book but don't let's worry about it now let's have some real news tell me all about the Sha Frodo hid the ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory the light and music of rivendel was about him again Bilbo smiled and laughed happily every item of news from

          
          11:06:54
          the Sha that Frodo could tell aided and corrected now and again by Sam was of the greatest interest to him from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hobbiton they were so deep in the doings of the four farings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth for many minutes he stood looking down at the with a smile suddenly Bilbo looked up ah there you are at last dunadan he cried Strider said Frodo you seem to have a lot of names well Strider is one that I haven't

          
          11:07:33
          heard before anyway said Bilbo what do you call him that for they call me that in Brie said Strider laughing and that is how I was introduced to him and why do you call him dunadan asked Frodo the dunadan said Bilbo he's often called that here but I thought you knew enough Elvish at least to know dadan man of the West n manorian but this is not the time for lessons he turned to Strider where have you been my friend why weren't you at the feast the lady aen was there Strider looked down at Bilbo Gravely

          
          11:08:16
          I know he said but often I must put MTH aside Elan and elro here have returned out of the wild un looked for and they had Tidings that I wish to hear at once well my dear fellow said Bilbo now you've heard the news can't you spare me a moment I want your help in something urgent elron says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening and I'm stuck let's go off into a corar and polish it up Strider smiled come then he said let me hear it Frodo was left to himself for a while

          
          11:08:54
          for Sam had fallen asleep he was alone and feeling rather forlorn although all about him the folk of rivendel were gathered but those near him were silent intent upon the music of the voices and the instruments and they gave no heed to anything else Frodo began to listen at first the beauty of the Melodies and of the interwoven words in Elven tongues even though he understood them little held him in a spell as soon as he began to attend to them almost it seemed that the words took shape and visions of far

          
          11:09:27
          lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him and the firet hall became like a golden Mist above Seas of foam that side upon the margins of the world then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike until he felt that an Endless River of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended it became part of the throbbing air about him and it drenched and drowned him swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of

          
          11:10:00
          sleep there he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water and then suddenly into a voice it seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses faint at first and then clear around the words a andil was a mariner that tarried in our veran he built a boat of Timber Fel in dimel to journey in her salsy wo of silver Fair of silver were her lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a swan and light upon her banners laid in panoply of ancient Kings in chained Rings he armored him his shining

          
          11:10:42
          Shield was scored with runes to Ward all wounds and arm from him his bow was made of dragon horn his Arrow Shor of ebony of silver was his Huron his Scabbard of Caledon his sword of Steel was Valiant of adamant his helmet tall an eagle Plum upon his Crest upon his breast an emerald beneath the moon and under star he wandered far from northern strands bewildered on in Enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands from nashing of the narrow ice where Shadow lies on fro and hills from nether Heats and burning

          
          11:11:26
          waste he turned in haste and roving still on starless Waters far astray at last he came to night of note and passed and never sight he saw of shining sha or light he sought The Winds of wroth came driving him and blindly in the foam he fled from west to east and endless unheralded he home would spit there flying elwing came to him and Flame was in the darkness lit more bright than light of diamond the fire upon her carinet the saril she bound on him and crowned him with the living light and dauntless then with burning brow he

          
          11:12:12
          turned his prow and in the night from other world Beyond the Sea there strong and free a storm arose a wind of par in t menel by paths that seldom mortal goes his boat it bore with biting breath as might of death across the gray and long forsaken Seas distressed from east to west he passed away through ever night he back was born on black and roaring waves that ran all Lees unlit and founded Shores that drowned before the days began until he heard on strands of pearl when ends the world the music long wherever foaming

          
          11:12:58
          Billows roll the yellow gold and jewels wor he saw the mountain silent rise where Twilight lies upon the knees of venor and elar beheld a far beyond the Seas a Wanderer escaped from night to Haven white he came at last to Elven home the green and fair where Keen the air where pale as glass beneath the hill of Il Marin a glimmer in a valley Shear the lampl towers of tyon are mirrored on the shadow mirr he carried there from erent Tre and Melodies they taught to him and sages owed him marbles told and harps of gold

          11:15:13
          on high above the Mists he came a distant flame before the sun a Wonder a the waking Dawn where gray the Norland Waters run and over Middle Earth he passed and heard at last the Weeping saw of women and of Elven maids in Elder days in years of your but on him Mighty Doom was laid till Moon should fade and all bed star to pass and T never more on hither Shores where Mortals are forever still a Herald on an errand that should never rest to bear his shining lamp ofar the flammifer of westernness the chanting ceased Frodo

          opened his eyes and saw that Bilbo was Seated on his stool in a circle of listeners who was smiling and applauding now we had better have it again said Bilbo got up and bowed I'm flattered Linder he said but it would be too tiring to repeat it all not too tiring for you the elves answered laughing you know you're never tired of reciting your own verses but really we can't answer your question at one hearing what cried Bilbo you can't tell which parts were mine and which were the dunad it's not easy for us to tell the

          
          11:16:44
          difference between two Mortals said the elf nonsense Linda snorted Bilbo if you can't distinguish between a man and a hobbit your judgment is poorer than I imagined they're as different as peas and apples maybe to sheep other Sheep No Doubt appear different laughed Linder or to Shepherds but Mortals have not been our study we have other business I won't argue with you said Bilbo I'm sleepy after so much music and singing I'll leave you to guess if you want to he got up and came towards Frodo well that's over he said in a low

          
          11:17:26
          voice it went off better than I expected I don't often get asked for a second hearing what did you think of it I'm not going to try and guess said froda smiling you needn't said Bilbo as a matter of fact it was all mine except that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone he seemed to think it was important I don't know why otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses about the irandil in the house of elron it was my

          
          11:18:03
          Affair I suppose he was right I don't know said Frodo it seemed to me to fit somehow though I can't explain I was half asleep when you began and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about I didn't understand that it was really you speaking until near the end it's difficult to keep awake here until you get used to it said Bilbo not that hoberts would ever acquire quite the Elish appetite for music and poetry and tales they seem to like them as much as food or more they will be going on

          
          11:18:41
          for a long time yet what do you say to is slipping off for some more quiet talk can we said Frodo of course this is medy making not business come and go as you like as long as you don't make a noise they got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows and made for the doors Sam they left behind fast asleep still with a smile on his face in spite of his Delight in Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the Hall of Fire even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice Rose in

          
          11:19:25
          [Music] song oh [Music] [Music] Frodo halted for a moment looking back elron was in his chair and the th was on his face like summerlight upon the trees near him Sat the lady Arwin to his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn Stood Beside her his dark cloak was thrown back and he seemed to be clad in Elven maale and a star Shone on his breast they spoke together and then suddenly it seemed to Frodo that aen turned towards him and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart he stood still and chanted while

          
          11:20:40
          the sweet syllables of the Elish song fell like clear jewels of Blended word and Melody it's a song to elberth said Bilbo they will sing that and other songs of the Blessed realm many times tonight come on he led Frodo back to his own little room it opened onto the gardens and looked South across the Ravine of the Bruin there they sat for some time looking through the windows at the bright stars above the steep climbing woods and talking Softly they spoke no more of the small news of the Sha far away nor of the Dark Shadows

          
          11:21:20
          and perils that encompassed them but of the fair things they had seen in the world together of the elves of the stars of trees and the gentle fall of the bright ear in the woods at last there came a knock on the door beging your pardon said Sam putting in his head but I was just wondering if he would be wanting anything and begging yours Sam gamji replied Bilbo I guess you mean that it's time your master went to bed well sir there is a counsil early tomorrow I hear and he only got up today for the first time quite right Sam laugh

          
          11:22:01
          Bilbo you can Trot off and tell Gandalf that he's gone to bed good night Frodo bless me but it's been good to see you again there are no folk like Hobbits after all for a real good talk I'm getting very old and I begin to wonder if I should ever live to see your chapters of our story good night I'll take a walk I think and look at the stars of elberth in the garden sleep well chapter 2 the Council of [Music] Elon next day Frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well he walked Along The Terraces above the

          
          11:22:47
          loud flowing bruinen and watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine down slanting through the thin Silver Mist the Dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering and the woen Nets of gossamer twinkled on every Bush Sam walked beside him saying nothing but sniffing the air and looking every now and again with Wonder in his eyes at the Great Heights in the East the snow was white upon their peaks on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path They Came Upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in

          
          11:23:23
          talk hello good morning said Bilbo feel ready for the great Council I feel ready for anything answered Frodo but most of all I should like to go walking today and explore the valley I should like to get into those pinewoods up there he pointed away far up the side of rivendel to the north you may have a chance later said Gandalf but we can't make any plans yet there's much to hear and decide today suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out that is the warning Bell for the Council of elrond cried Gandalf come

          
          11:24:06
          along now both you and Bilbo wanted Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house behind them Uninvited and for the moment forgotten trotted Sam gandal LED them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before the light of the clear Autumn morning was now glowing in the valley the noise of bubbling Waters came up from the foaming riverbed birds were singing and a wholesome piece lay on the land to Frodo his dangerous flight and the rumors of the darkness growing in

          
          11:24:44
          the world World outside already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave El Rond was there and several others were seated in Silence about him fra saw glorfindel and gloin and in a corner alone Strider was sitting clad in his travel worn clothes again elrond Drew Frodo to a seat by his side and presented him to the company saying here my friends is The Hobbit Frodo son of Drogo few have ever come hither through greater Peril or on an errand

          
          11:25:24
          more urgent he then pointed out and named Those whom Frodo had not met before there was a younger dwarf at glo's side his son gimy beside glorfindel there were several other counselors of elon's household of whom aresto was the chief and with him was galdor an elf from the grey Havens who had come on an errand from kydan the ship right there was also a strange elf clad in green and brown Legolas a messenger from his father thranduil the king of the elves of Northern merkwood and seated a little apart was a

          
          11:26:04
          tall man with a fair and Noble face darkhaired and gray eyed proud and stern of glance he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on Horseback and indeed though his garments were rich and his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with long travel he had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set his locks were Shor about his shoulders on a Baldrick he wore a Great Horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees he gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden Wonder here said elron turning to

          
          11:26:46
          Gandalf is bomir a man from the south he arrived in the gray morning and seeks for councel I have bidden him to be present for here his questions will be answered not all that was spoken and debated in the council need now be told much was said of events in the world outside especially in the South and in the wide lands east of the mountains of these things Frodo had already heard many rumors but the tale of gloin was new to him and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively it appeared that amid the

          
          11:27:24
          Splendor of their works of hand the hearts of the dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were troubled it is now many years ago said glne that the shadow of dis quiet fell Upon Our People whence it came we did not at first perceive words began to be whispered in secret it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that greater wealth and Splendor would be found in a wider World some spoke of Moria the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue C our doom and they declare that now at last we had the

          
          11:28:04
          powers and numbers to return gloin sigh moror moror wonder of the northern world too deep we delv there and woke the nameless fear long have its vast Mansions Lin empty since the children of Doran fled but now we spoke of it again with longing and yet with Dread for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of khazard Doom for many lives of Kings save th only and he perished at last however barlin listened to The Whispers and resolved to and though Dane did not give leave willingly he took with him ay and O and

          
          11:28:51
          many of our folk and they went away South that was n on 30 years ago for a while we had news and it seemed good messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work begun there then there was silence and no word has ever come from Moria since then about a year ago a mess messenger came to D but not from Mora from Mordor a horseman in the night who called D to his gate the Lord s and the great so he said wished for our friendship rings he would give for it such as he gave of old and he asked

          
          11:29:33
          urgently concerning Hobbits of what kind they were and where they dwelt for saon knows he said that one of these was known to you on a Time at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer and then his voice was lowered and he would have sweetened it if he could as a small token only of your friendship saurin asks this he said that you should find this thief such was his word and get from him willing or no a little ring the least of rings that once he stole it is but a trifle that saon fancies and an Earnest of your good

          
          11:30:16
          will find it and three rings that the dwarf SS possessed of old shall be returned to you and the realm of Moria shall be yours forever find only news of the thief whether he still lives and where and you shall have great reward and Lasting friendship from the Lord refuse and things will not seem so well do you refuse at that his breath came like the hiss of of snakes and all who stood by shuddered but Dyan said I say neither yay nor nay I must consider this message and what it means under its Fair cloak

          
          11:30:57
          consider well but not too long said he the time of my thought is my own to spend answered Dan for the present said he and rode into the darkness heavy have the hearts of our Chieftain be since that night we needed not the fail voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both Menace and deceit for we knew already that the path that has re-entered Mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of old twice the messenger has returned and is gone unanswered the third and last time so he says is soon to come before the

          
          11:31:39
          ending of the year and so I have been sent At Last by Diane to warn Bilbo that he sought by the enemy and to learn if may be why he desires this ring this least of rings also We crave the advice of Elrod for the shadow grows and draws nearer we discover that Messengers have come also to King Brandon Dale and that he is afraid we fear that he may yield already war is gathering on his Eastern borders if we make no answer the enemy may move men of his rule to a sail King brand and de also you have done well to come said

          
          11:32:24
          Eland you will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purposes of the enemy there is not that you can do other than to resist with hope or without it but you do not stand alone you will learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the Western world the ring what shall we do with the ring the least of rings the trifle that sour and fancies that is the Doom that we must deem that is the purpose for which you were called hither called I say though I have not called you to me strangers from

          
          11:33:02
          distant lands you have come and are here met in this very nick of time by chance as it may seem yet it is not so believe rather that it is so ordered that we who sit here and none others must now find counsel for The Perils of the world now therefore things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a few until this day and first so that all may understand what is in the Peril the tale of the Ring shall be told from the beginning even to this present and I will begin that tale though others shall end it

          
          11:33:45
          they' all listened while Elon in his clear voice spoke of saur and the ring of power and their forging in the second age of the world long ago a part of his tale was known to some there but the full Tale To None and many eyes were turned to Elon in fear and wonder as he told of the Elven Smiths of Rion and their friendship with Moria and their eagerness for knowledge by which sa and and snared them for that time he was not yet evil to behold and they received his Aid and grew Mighty in craft whereas he

          
          11:34:21
          learned all their secrets and betrayed them and forged secretly in the mountain of far the one ring to be their Master but krimo was aware of him and hid the three which he had made and there was War and the land was laid waste and the Gate of morio was shut then through all the years that followed he tricked the ring but since that history is elsewhere accounted even as elron himself set it down in his books of law it is not here recalled for it is a long Tale full of Deeds great and terrible and briefly

          
          11:34:59
          though elron spoke the sun rode up the sky and the morning was passing a he ceased of no Menor he spoke its glory and its fall and the return of the Kings to Middle Earth out of the the deeps of the sea born upon the wings of storm then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isor and anarion became great Lords and the north realm they made in aror and the South realm and Gondor above the Milds of andwin but sain of Mordor assailed them and they made the last Alliance of elves and men and the hosts of gilgalad and

          
          11:35:42
          elendel were mustered in aror thereupon Elon paused a while and sigh I remember well the Splendor of their banners he said it recalled to me the glory of the Elder days and the hosts of beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembled and yet not so many nor so fair as when thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed that evil was ended forever and it was not so you remember said Frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment but I thought he stammered as Elon turned towards him I thought

          
          11:36:25
          that the fate of Gil galled was a long ago time so it was indeed answered elron Gravely but my memory reaches back even to the Elder days a arandel was my sir who was born in gondolin before its fall and my mother was elwing daughter of Dior son of Luan of Dorth I have seen three ages in the west of the world and many defeats and many fruitless victories I was the herald of Gil galladon marched with his host I was at the Battle of dagorlad before the black gate of Mordor when we had the master for the Spear of gilgalad and the sword

          
          11:37:11
          of elendil agos and naril none could withstand I beheld the last Combat on the slopes of orodruin where gilgalad died and elendil fell and naril broke beneath him but saurin himself was overthrown and isor cut the ring from his hand with a hilt Shard of his father's sword and took it for his own at this The Stranger bmir broke in so that is what became of the Ring he cried if ever such a tale was told in the South it has long been forgotten I've heard of the great Ring of him that we do not name but we believe that it

          
          11:37:54
          perished from the world in the ruin of his first realm isor took it that is Tidings indeed alas yes said Elon isor took it that should not have been it should have been cast then into orodruin fire night hand where it was made but few marked what isor did he alone stood by his father in that last mortal contest and by Gil galled only kidan stood and die but isor would not listen to our counsel this I will have as were Guild for my father and my brother he said and therefore whether we would or no he took

          
          11:38:38
          it to treasure it but soon he was betrayed by it to his death and so it is named in the north isor Bane yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him only to the north did these Tidings come and only to a few small wonder it is that you have not heard them barir from the ruin of the gladen fields where isor perished three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering one of these was orar the Esquire of is Who Bore the shards of the sword of elendil and he brought them to valandil

          
          11:39:20
          the heir of isor who being but a child had remained here in rivendel but naril was broken and its light extinguished and it has not yet been forged again fruitless did I call the victory of the last Alliance not wholly so yet it did not achieve its end saurin was diminished but not destroyed his ring was lost but not unmade The Dark Tower was broken but its foundations were not removed for they were made with the power of the ring and while it remains they will endure many elves and many mighty men and many of their friends had

          
          11:40:03
          pished in the war and Aran was slain and isalo was slain and Gil galled and elendil were no more never again shall there any such leagues of elves and men for men multiply and the firstborn decrease and the two kindreds are estranged and ever since that day the race of num Menor has decayed and the span of their years is lessened in the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the men of West andessa were diminished and their city of annuminas besides Lake evendim fell into ruin and The Heirs of

          
          11:40:46
          the landel removed and dwelt at fornost on the high North downs and that now too is desolate men call it dead men's Dyke and they Fear To Tread there for the folk of aror dwindled and their foes devoured them and their lordship passed leaving only green Mounds in the grassy Hills in the South the realm of Gondor long endured and for a while its Splendor grew recalling somewhat of the might of numo a it fell High towers that people built and strong places and havens of many ships and the winged crown of the kings of men was held in

          
          11:41:31
          awe by folk of many tongues their Chief city was OS gilo cadle of the Stars through the midst of which the river flowed and Minas is Hill they built Tower Of The Rising Moon Eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of Shadow and West fo at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made Tower of the Setting Sun there in the courts of the king grow a white tree from the seed of that tree which isor brought over the Deep Waters and the seed of that tree before came from ARA and before that out of the

          
          11:42:12
          uttermost in the day before days when the world was young but in the wearing of the Swift years of Middle Earth the line of menil son of an Arian failed and the tree withered and the blood of the num manorian became mingled with that of lesser men then the watch upon the walls of Mordor slept and dark things crept back to gorgoroth and on a Time evil things came forth and they took Minas ethil and Abode in it and they made it into a place of dread and it is called Minas morgal then Minas Anor was named a New

          
          11:42:55
          Minas tith the Tower of God and these two cities were ever at War but o gillath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins Shadows walked so it has been for many lives of men but the Lords of min still fight on defying our enemies keeping the passage of the River from argonath to the Sea and now that part of the tale that I shall tell is drawn to its close for in the days of isor the ruling ring passed out of all knowledge and the three were released from its Dominion but now in this Latter day they are in

          
          11:43:37
          Peril once more for to our sorrow the one has been found others shall speak of its finding for in that I played small part he ceased but at once Bomer stood up tall and proud before them give me leave Master elron said he first to say more of Gondor for verily from the land of Gondor I am come and it would be well for all to know what passes there for few I deem know of our deeds and and therefore guess little of their Peril if we should fail at last believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of numor is spent nor

          
          11:44:24
          all its pride and dignity forgotten by our Valor the wild folk of the East is still restrained and the terror of morgull kept it Bay and thus alone a Peace and Freedom maintained in the lands behind us bulwark of the west but if the passages of the river should be one what then yet that hour maybe is not now far away the nameless enemy has arisen again smoke Rises once more from aod druin that we call Mount Doom the power of the black land grows and we are hard beset when the enemy returned our folk were

          
          11:45:02
          driven from ethelon our Fair domain east of the river though we kept a foot hold there and strength of arms but this very year in the days of June sudden War Came Upon Us out of Mordor and we were Swept Away we were outnumbered for Mordor has Allied itself with the easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was not by numbers that we were defeated a power was there that we have not felt before some said that it could be seen like a great black Horseman a dark shadow under the moon wherever he came a

          
          11:45:39
          Madness filled our foes that fear fell on our boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled only a remnant of our Eastern Force came back destroying the last bridge that stood amid the ruins of O gillath I was in the company that Hil the bridge until it was cast down behind us four only were saved by swimming my brother and myself and two others but still we fight on holding all the West shores of andwin and those who shelter behind us give us praise if ever they hear our name much praise but little

          
          11:46:17
          help only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we call in this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to elron 110 days I have journeyed all alone but I do not seek Allies in War the might of elron is in wisdom not in weapons it is said I come to ask for counsel and the unraveling of heart words for on the eve of the sudden assault a Dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards a like Dream came off to him again and once to me in that dream I thought the Eastern

          
          11:46:58
          Sky grew dark and there was a growing Thunder but in the west a pale light lingered and out of it I Heard a Voice remote but clear crying seek for the sword that was broken in imladris it dwells there shall be counsels taken stronger than more gold spells there shall be shown a token that Doom is near at hand for islor's Bane shall waken and the halfling forth shall stand of these words we could understand little and we spoke to our father denior Lord of minth wise and the Lord of Gondor this only would he say that

          
          11:47:41
          imladris was of old the name among the elves of a far Northern Dale where Elon the half Elven dwelt greatest of law Masters therefore my brother seeing how desperate was our need was eager to heed the dream and seek for imis but since the way was full of doubt and danger I took the journey upon myself loath was my father to give me leave and long have I wandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of iland of which many had heard but you knew where it lay and here in the house of elron more shall be made clear to you said Aragon

          
          11:48:21
          standing up he cast his sword upon the table that stood before Eland and the blade was in two pieces here is a sword that was broken he said and who are you and what have you to do with Min tith asked Boromir looking in Wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and his weather stained cloak he he is Aragon son of arathor said Eland and he is descended through many fathers from isor elendil son of minus iil he is the chief of the dunad in the north and few are now left of that folk then it belongs to you and not to

          
          11:49:05
          me at all cried Frodo in amazement springing to his feet as if he expected the ring to be demanded at once it does not belong to either of us said Aragon but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while bring out the ring Frodo said Gandalf solemnly the time has come hold it up and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle there was a hush and all turned their eyes on Frodo he was shaken by a sudden shame and fear and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the ring and a loathing of its

          
          11:49:47
          touch he wished he was Far Away the ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand behold islor's Bane said Eland boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing the halfling he muttered is then the Doom of Min tith come at last but why then should we seek a broken sword the words were not the Doom of minth said Aragon but doom and great Deeds are indeed at hand for the sword that was broken is a sword of elendil that broke beneath him when he fell it has been treasured by his hirs when all

          
          11:50:31
          other heirlooms were lost for it was spoken of old Among Us that it should be made again when the ring islor's Bane was found now you have seen the sword that you have sort what would you ask do you wish for the house of alil to return to the land of Gondor I was not sent to beg any Boone but to seek only the meaning of a riddle answered Boromir proudly yet we are hard pressed and the sword of elendil would be a help beyond our hope if such a thing could indeed return Out of the Shadows of the past he looked again at

          
          11:51:10
          Aragorn and doubt was in his eyes Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side evidently he was annoyed on his friend's behalf standing suddenly up he burst out all that is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost the old that is strong does not wither deep roots are not reached by the frost From the Ashes of fire shall be woken a light from the shadow shall spring renewed should be blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king not very good perhaps but to the point if you need more beyond the word

          
          11:51:52
          of Elrod if that was worth a journey of 110 days to hear you had best listen to it he sat down with a snort I made that up myself he whispered to Frodo for the dunadan a long time ago when he first told me about himself I almost wish that my Adventures were not over and that I could go with him when his day comes Aragon smiled at him then he turned to bmir again for my part I forgive your doubt he said little do I resemble the figures of alil and isor as they stand carven in their Majesty in the halls of

          
          11:52:37
          denior I am but the heir of isor not isor himself I've had a hard life and a long and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small part in the count of my Journeys I've crossed many mountains and many rivers and trodden many Plains even into the far countries of Ru and harod where the stars are strange but my home such as I have is in the north for here The Heirs of valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many Generations our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever the sword has

          
          11:53:20
          passed to a new keeper and this I will say to you Boromir a I end lonely men are we Rangers of the wild hunters but Hunters ever of the Servants of the enemy for they are found in many places not in Mordor only if Gondor B has been a stallwood tower we have played another part many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay you know little of the Lands Beyond your bounds Peace and Freedom do you say the north would have known them little but for us fear would have destroyed them but when

          
          11:54:06
          dark things come from the houseless hills or Creep from sunless woods they fly from us what roads would any Dare To Tread what safety would there be in quiet lands or in the homes of simple men at night if the Dune of Dian were asleep or were all gone into the grave and yet less thanks of we than you Travelers scowl at us and countrymen give us scornful names Strider I am to one fat man who lives within a day's March of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little town in ruin if we were not guarded

          
          11:54:45
          ceaselessly yet we would not have it otherwise if simple folk are free from care and fear simple they will be and we must be secret to keep them so that has been the task of my Kindred while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown but now the world is changing once again a new hour comes islor's banee is found battle is at hand the sword shall be reforged I will come to Min tith islor's ban is found you say said bmir I have seen a bright ring in the harling's hand but isor perished a this

          
          11:55:28
          age of the world began they say how do the wise know that this ring is his and how has it passed down the years until it is brought hither by so strange a messenger that shall be told said Elon but not yet I beg Master said Bilbo already the sun is climbing to noon and I feel the need of something to strengthen me I had not named you said Elon smiling but I do so now come tell us your tale and if you have not yet cast your story into verse you may tell it in plain words the briefer the sooner shall you

          
          11:56:10
          be refreshed very well said Bilbo I will do as you bid but I will now tell the true story and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise he looked sidelong at glne I asked them to forget it and forgive me I only wished to claim the treasure as my very own in those days and to be rid of the name of thief that was put on me but perhaps I understand things a little better now anyway this is what happened to some there Bilbo's tale was wholly new and they listened with amazement while the old Hobbit actually

          
          11:56:53
          not at all displeased recounted his adventure with Gollum at full length he did not omit a single riddle he would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the sh if he had been allowed but elron raised his hand well told my friend he said but that is enough at this time for the moment it suffices to know that the ring passed to Frodo your Heir let him now speak then less willingly than Bilbo Frodo told of all his dealings with the ring from the day that it passed into his keeping every step of his journey

          
          11:57:34
          from hobbiton to the Ford of Bruin and was questioned and considered and everything that he could tell concerning the Black Riders was a examined at last he sat down not bad Bilbo said to him you would have made a good story of it if they hadn't kept on interrupting I tried to make a few notes but we should have to go over it all again together sometime if I'm to write it up there are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here yes it made quite a long tale answered Frodo but the story still does

          
          11:58:12
          not seem complete to me I still want to know a good deal especially from gandal galor of the Havens who sat nearby overheard him you speak for me also he cried and turning to Elon he said the wise may have good reason to believe that the halflings Trove is indeed the great rig of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who know less but may we not hear the proofs and I would ask this also what of seron he is learned in The Lord of the Rings yet he is not among us what is his counsel if he knows the

          
          11:58:52
          things that we have heard the questions that you ask galdor abound together said Elon I had not overlooked them and they shall be answered but these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear and I call upon him last for it is the place of honor and in all this matter he has been the chief some galor said Gandalf would think the tidings of gloin and the pursuit of Frodo proof enough that the halflings Trove is a thing of great Worth to the enemy yet it is a ring what then the nine the nasgul keep the seven are taken

          
          11:59:37
          or destroyed at this gloin stirred but did not speak the three we know of what then is this one that he desires so much there is indeed a wide waste of time between the river and the mountain between the loss and the finding but the Gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last yet too slowly for the enemy has been close behind closer even than I feared and well it is that not until this year this very summer as it seems did wear learn the full truth some here will remember that many

          
          12:00:17
          years ago I myself dared to pass the doors of The Necromancer IND do gor and secretly explored his ways and found thus that our fears were true he was none other than saurin our enemy of old at length taking shape and power again some too will remember also that saran dissuaded us from open Deeds against him and for long we watched him only yet at last as his shadow grew San yielded and the council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of merkwood and that was in the very year of the finding of

          
          12:00:56
          this ring a strange chance if chance it was but we were too late as Elon foresaw Sauron also had watched us and had long prepared against our stroke governing Mordor from afar through minus morgal where his nine servants dwelt until all was ready then he gave way before us but only fed to flee and soon after came to the Dark Tower and openly declared himself then for the last time the council met for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one we feared then that he had some news

          
          12:01:38
          of it that we knew nothing of but Saron said no and repeated what he had said to us before that the one would never again be found in Middle Earth at the worst said he our enemy knows that we have it not and that it still is lost but what was lost May yet be found he thinks fear not his hope will cheat him have I not earnestly studied this matter into andwin the great it fell and long ago while saon slept it was rolled down the river to the Sea there let it lie Until the End gandal felt silent gazing Eastward

          
          12:02:21
          from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains at whose great Roots the Peril of the world had so long laying hidden he sighed there I was at fault he said I was lulled by the words of San the wise but I should have sought for the truth sooner and our Peril would now be less we were all at fault said Elon and but for your vigilance the darkness maybe would already be upon us but say on from the first my heart misgave me against all reason that I knew said Gandalf and I desired to know how this

          
          12:03:02
          thing came to Gollum and how long he had possessed it so I set a watch for him guessing that he would air long come forth from his Darkness to seek for his treasure he came but he escaped and was not found and then alas I let the meta rest watching and waiting only as we have too often done time passed with many cares until my doubts would awakened again to sudden fear whence came the hobbit's ring what if my fear was true should be done with it those things I must decide but I spoke yet of my dread To None knowing

          
          12:03:45
          the Peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray in all the long Wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest foe that was 17 years ago soon I became aware that spies of many sorts even beasts and birds were gathered around the sh and my fear grew I called for the help of the dunad and their watch was doubled and I opened my heart to Aragon the heir of isor and I said Aragon counsel that we should Hunt for Gollum too late though it may seem and since it seemed fit that islor's Heir should labor to repair

          
          12:04:27
          islor's fault I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of wilderland down even to the mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor there we had rumor of him and we guessed that he dwelt there long in the dark Hills but we never found him and At Last I despaired and there in my despair I thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded the ring itself might tell if it were the one the memory of words at the council came back to me words of

          
          12:05:07
          seron half heated at the time I heard them now clearly in my heart the nine the seven and the three he said had each their proper gem not so the one it was round and unadorned as it were one of the Lesser rings but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled maybe could still see and read what those marks were he had not said who now would know the maker and San but great though his law may be it must have a source what hand save saens ever held this thing a it was lost the hand of isor alone with that thought I

          
          12:05:56
          forsook the Chase and passed swiftly Gondor in former days the members of my order had been well received there but seron most of all often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of the city less welcomed the Lord denior show me then than of old and grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded Scrolls and books if indeed you look only as you say for records of ancient days and the beginnings of the city read on he said for to me what was is less dark than what is to come and that is my care but

          
          12:06:36
          unless you have more skill even than San who has studied here long you will find find not that is not well known to me who am Master of the Lord of this city so said denior and yet there lie in his horde many records that few now can read even of the law Masters for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men and Boromir there lies in Min still unread I guess by any save San and myself since the Kings failed a scroll that isor made himself for isor did not March away straight from the war in

          
          12:07:17
          Mordor as some have told the tale some in the north maybe bmir broke in all knowing Gondor that he went first to minor and dwelt a while with his nephew menil instructing him before he committed to him the rule of the South Kingdom in that time he planted there the last sapling of the white tree in memory of his brother but in that time also he made this scroll said Gandalf and that is not remembered in Gondor it would seem for this scroll concerns the ring and thus wrote isor therein the great Ring shall go now to

          
          12:08:00
          be an heirloom of the north Kingdom but records of it should be left in Gondor where also dwell the Hees of elendil lest a Time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim and after these words isor described the ring such as he found it it was hot when I first took it hot as a gleed and my hand was scorched so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it yet even as I write it is cold and it seeth to shrink though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shape already

          
          12:08:40
          the writing upon it which it first was as clear as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read it is fashioned in an Elven script of Arian for they have no letters in Mordor for such subtle work but the language is unknown to me I deem it to be a tongue of the Blackland since it is foul and uncouth what evil it Seth I do not know but I trace here a copy of it lest it fade Beyond recall the ring misses maybe the heat of sauron's hand which was black and yet burned like fire and so Gil galled was destroyed and maybe where

          
          12:09:22
          the gold made hot again the writing would be refreshed but for my part I will risk no hurt to this thing of all the works of Sauron the only fair it is precious to me though I buy it with great pain when I read these words my quest was ending for the traced writing was indeed as isor guest in the tongue of Mordor and the Servants of the Tower and what was said therein was already known for in the day that saurin first put on the one krimo maker of the three was aware of him and from afar he heard him speak

          
          12:10:04
          these words and so his evil purposes were revealed at once I took my leave of denior but even as I went northwards messages came to me out of lauan that Aragon had passed that way and that he had found the creature called Gollum therefore I went first to meet him and hear his tale into what deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not guess there is little need to tell of them said Aragon if a man must needs walk in sight of the black gate or tread the deadly flowers of morgal veil then perils he will have I too despaired

          
          12:10:45
          at last and I began my homood journey and then by Fortune I came suddenly on what I sought the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool but now the trail was fresh and Swift and it led not to Mordor but away Along the skirts of the Dead marshes I followed it and then I had him lurking by a stagnant mirror peering in the water as the dark Eve fell I caught him Gollum he was covered with green slime he will never love me I fear for he bit me and I was not gentle nothing more did I ever get from his

          
          12:11:24
          mouth than the marks of his teeth I deemed it the worst part of all my journey the road back watching him day and night making him walk before me with a halter on his neck gagged until he was tamed by lack of drink and food driving him ever towards merkwood I brought him that at last and gave him to the elves for we had agreed that this should be done and I was glad to be rid of his company for he stank for my part I hope never to look upon him again but Gandalf came and endured long speech with

          
          12:11:59
          him yes long and weary said Gandalf but not without profit for one thing the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now told openly for the first time but that mattered little since I had already guessed it but I learned then first that gollum's ring came out of the Great River night of the gladen fields and I learned also that he had possessed it long many lives of his small kind the power of the Ring had lengthened his years far beyond their span but that power only the great Rings

          
          12:12:40
          wield and if that that is not proof enough galdor there is the other test that I spoke of upon this very ring which you have here seen held aoft round and unadorned the letters that isor reported may still be read if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the far while that I have done and this I have read Ash nzb Ash NZ gimb as is the change in the Wizard's voice was astounding suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as Stone a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and the porch

          
          12:13:29
          for a moment grew dark all trembled and the elves stopped their ears never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in imladris Gandalf the Ray said Elon as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more and let us hope that none will ever speak it here again answered Gandalf nonetheless I do not ask your pardon Master Eland for if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the west then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the wise have declared The Treasure of the enemy

          
          12:14:08
          fraught with all his malice and in it lies a great great part of his strength of old out of the black years come the words that the Smiths of Aron heard and knew that they had been betrayed one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them know also my friends that I learned more yet from Gollum he was Lo to speak and his tale was unclear but it is beyond all doubt that he went to Mordor and there all that he knew was forced from him thus the enemy knows now that the one is

          
          12:14:47
          found that it was long in the sh and since his servants have pursued it almost to our door he soon will know already he may know even as I speak that we have it here all sat silent for a while until at length Boromir spoke here is a small thing you say this Gollum small but great in Mischief what came of him to what Doom did you put him he is in prison now but no worse said Aragon he had suffered much there is no doubt that he was tormented and the fear of Sauron lies black on his heart still I for one I'm glad that he is safely

          
          12:15:28
          kept by the watchful elves of merkwood his malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered he could work much Mischief still if he were free and I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some evil errand alas alas cried Legolas and in his fair Elish face there was great distress the tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told they are not good but only here have I learned how evil they may seem to this company smeel who is now called Gollum

          
          12:16:06
          has escaped escaped cried Aragorn that is ill news indeed we shall all Ru it bitterly I fear how came the folk of Sandu to fail in the trust not through lack of watchfulness said legus but perhaps through overk kindliness and we fear that the prisoner has aid from others and that more is known of our doing than we could wish we guarded this creature day and night at Gandalf's bidding much though we weared of the task but Gandalf bad us hope still for his cure and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeons under

          
          12:16:45
          the Earth where he would fall back into his old black thoughts you were less tender to me said gloin with a flash in his eyes as old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the Deep places of the Elven King's Halls now come said Gandalf pray do not interrupt my good gloin that was a regrettable misunderstanding long set right if all the grievance of that stand between elves and dwarves that to be brought up here we may as well abandon this Council glowing Rose and bowed and legus continued in the days of fair weather we

          
          12:17:24
          LED Gollum through the woods and there was a high tree standing alone far from the others which he liked to climb often we let him Mount up to the highest branches until he felt the free wind but we set a guard at the trees foot one day he refused to come down and the gods had no mind to climb after him he had learned the trick of clinging to bows with his feet as well as with his hands so they sat by the tree far into the night it was that very night of summer yet moonless and starless that Orcs came

          
          12:17:58
          on us at unawares we drove them off after some time there were many and fierce but they came from over the mountains and were unused to the woods when the battle was over we found that Gollum was gone and his guards were slain or taken it then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his rescue and that he knew of it beforehand how that was contrived we cannot guess but golum is cutting and the spies of the enemy are many the dark things that were driven out in the year of the dragon's fall have returned in

          
          12:18:34
          greater numbers and merkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is maintained we have failed to recapture golum we came on his Trail among those of many Orcs And it had plunged deep into the forest going south but air long it escaped our skill and we dared not continue the hunt for we were drawing nigh to do gor and that is still a very evil place we do not go that way well well he is gone said Gandalf we have no time to seek for him again he must do what he will but he may play a part yet

          
          12:19:16
          that neither he nor sain have foreen and now I will answer gor's other question what of seron what are his counsels to us in this need this tale I must tell in full for only Elon has heard it and that in brief but it will bear on all that we must resolve it is the last chapter in the tail of the ring so far as it has yet gone at the end of June I was in the show but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind and I rode to the southern borders of the little land for I had a for boing of some danger still hidden from me but

          
          12:20:01
          Drawing Near their messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor and when I heard of the black shadow a CH Still Smoked my heart but I found nothing save a few fugitives from the south yet it seemed to me that on them set a fear of which they would not speak I turned then east and north and journeyed along the greenway and not far from brie I Came Upon a traveler sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him it was radagast the brown who at one time dwelt at hos goel near the the

          
          12:20:41
          borders of merkwood he is one of my order but I had not seen him for many a year gandal he cried I was seeking you but I am a stranger in these parts all I knew was that you might be found in a wild region with the uncouth name of sha your information was correct I said but do not put it in that way if you meet any of the inhabitants you near the borders of the Sha now and what do you want with me it must be pressing you were never a traveler unless driven by great need I have an urgent errand he said my

          
          12:21:19
          news is evil then he looked about him as if the hedges might have ears Nazgul he whispered the nine are abroad again they have crossed the river secretly and are moving Westward they have taken the guise of Riders In Black I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it the enemy must have some great need or purpose said rast for what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate Parts I cannot guess what do you mean said I I have been told wherever they go the writers ask for news of a land called

          
          12:22:03
          sh the sh I said but my heart sank for even the wise might fear to stand the nine when they are gathered together under their fell Chieftain a great king and sorcerer he was of old and now he wields a deadly fear who told you and who sent you I asked San the white answered radagast and he told me to say that if you feel the need he will help but you must seek his Aid at once or it will be too late and that message brought me hope for Salamon the white is the Great greatest of by order radagast is of

          
          12:22:44
          course a worthy wizard a master of shapes and changes of hue and he has much lore of herbs and beasts and birds are especially his friends but Saron has long studied the Arts of the enemy himself and thus we have often been able to forall him it was by the devices of Salamon that we drove him from do gor it might be that he had found some weapons that would drive back the dine I will go to Saron I said then you must go now said radagast for I have wasted time in looking for you and the days are running short I was told to

          
          12:23:25
          find you before Midsummer and that is now here even if you set out from this spot you will hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek I myself shall turn back at once and with that he mounted and would have rid straight off stay a moment I said we shall need your help and the help of all things that will give it send messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends tell them to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to Saran and Gandalf let messages be sent to

          
          12:24:01
          orank I will do that he said and rode off as if the nine were after him I could not follow him then and there I had ridden very far already that day and I was as weary as my horse and I needed to consider matters I stayed the night in Brie and decided that I had no time to return to the sh never did I make a greater mistake however I wrote a message to Frodo and trusted to my friend the inkeeper to send it to him I rode away at dawn and I came at long last to the dwelling of Saran that is far south in Eisen guard

          
          12:24:42
          in the end of the Misty Mountains not far from the gap of Rohan and Boromir will tell you that that is a great open Veil that lies between the Misty Mountains and the northmost foothills of ared nimra the White Mountains of his home but Eisen guard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall and in the midst of that Valley is a tower of stone called orun it was not made by Salamon but by the men of numo long ago and it is very tall and has many secrets yet it looks not to be a work of craft it cannot be reached

          
          12:25:24
          save by passing the circle of Eisen guard and in that Circle there is only one gate late one evening I came to the gate like a great arch in the wall of rock and it was strongly guarded but the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that San awaited me I rode under the arch and the gate closed silently behind me and suddenly I was afraid though I knew no reason for it but I rode to the foot of orthon and came to the stairs of seron and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber

          
          12:26:03
          he wore a ring on his finger so you have come gandal he said to me Gravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart yes I have come I said I have come for your Aid Saron the white and that title seemed to anger him have you indeed gandal the gray he scoffed for Aid it has seldom been heard of that gandal the gray sought for Aid one so cunning and so wise wandering about the lands and concerning himself in every business whether it belongs to him or

          
          12:26:46
          not I looked at him and wondered but if I am not deceived said I things are now moving which will require the union of all our strengths that may be so he said but the thought is late in coming to you how long I wonder have you concealed from me the head of the council a matter of greatest import what brings you now from your lurking place in the sh the nine have come forth again I answered they have crossed the river so radagast said to me radagast the brown laughed Saruman and he no longer concealed his Scorn ragas the bird

          
          12:27:31
          Tammer ragas the simple radagast the fool yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him for you have come and that was all the purpose of my message and here you will stay candal the gray and rest from Journeys for I am Saran the wise Saran Ring Maker Saran of Many Colors I looked then and saw that his robes which had seemed white were not so but were woven of all colors and if he moved they shimmered and changed to so that the eye was bewildered I like white better I said white he sneered it serves as a beginning white

          
          12:28:18
          cloth may be dyed the white page can be overwritten and the white light can be broken in which case it is no longer white I said and he that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom you need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take your friends said he I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you but to give you a choice he drew himself up then and began to declaim as if he were making a speech long rehearsed the Elder days are gone the middle days are passing the younger

          
          12:28:59
          days are beginning the time of the elves is over but our time is at hand the world of men which we must rule but we must have power power to order all all things as we will for that good which only the wise can see and listen Gandalf my old friend and helper he said coming near and speaking now in a softer voice I said we for we it may be if you will join with me a new power is rising against it the old allies and policies will not Avail us at all there is no hope left in elves or dying numor this then is one choice before you

          
          12:29:40
          before us we may join with that power it would be wise Gandalf there is hope that way it's victory is at hand and there will be rich reward for those that aided it as the power grows its proved friends will also grow and the wise such as you and I may with patience come at last to direct its courses to control it we can bite our time we can keep our thoughts in our hearts deploring any evils done by the way but approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledge rule order all the things that we have so far

          
          12:30:20
          striven in vain to accomplish hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends there need not be there would not be any real change in our designs only in our means San I said I have heard speeches of this kind before but only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant I cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears he looked at Miss sidelong and paused a while considering well I see that this wise course does not commend itself to you he said not yet not if some better way can

          
          12:31:05
          be contrived he came and laid his hand on my arm and why not gandal he whispered why not the ruling ring if we could command that then the power would pass to us that is in truth why I brought you here for I have many eyes in my service and I believe that you know where this precious thing now lies is it not so or why do the nine ask for the sh and what is your business there as he said this a last which he could not conceal sha suddenly in his eyes San I said standing away from him only one hand at a time can wield the

          
          12:31:50
          ring and you know that well so do not trouble to say we but I would not give it nay I would not give even news of it to you now that I learn your mind you were head of the council but you have unmasked yourself at last well the choices are it seems to submit to saurin or to yourself I will take neither have you others to offer he was cold now and perilous yes he said I did not expect you to show wisdom even in your own behalf but I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly and so saving yourself much trouble and

          
          12:32:34
          pain the third choice is to stay here until the end until what end until you reveal to me where the one may be found I may find means to persuade you or until it is found in your despite and the ruler has time to turn to lighter matters to devise say A fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of gandal the gy that may not prove to be one of the lighter matters said I he laughed at me for my words were empty and he knew it they took me and they set me alone on the Pinnacle of orank in the place where

          
          12:33:17
          San was accustomed to watch the stars there is no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps and the valley below seems far away I looked on it and saw that where as it had once been green and fair it was now filled with pits and forges wolves and Orcs were housed in Eisen guard for Saran was mastering a great force on his own account in rivalry of saurin and not in his service yet over all his Works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of orthon I stood alone on an island in the

          
          12:33:55
          clouds and I had no chance of escape and my days were bitter I was pierced with cold and I had but little room in which to Pace to and fro brooding on the coming of the Riders to the north that the nine had indeed Arisen I felt assured apart from the words of Saran which might be lies long a I came to Eisen guard I had heard Tidings by the way that could not be mistaken fear was ever in my heart for my friends in the Sha but still I had some hope I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once as my letter had urged and that he had reached

          
          12:34:35
          rivendel before the deadly Pursuit began and both my fear and my hope proved ill-founded for My Hope was founded on a fat man in Brie and my fear was founded on the cunning of saon but fat men who have many calls to answer and the power of sa is still less than fear makes it but in the circle of Eisen guard trapped and alone it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all had fled or Fallen would falter in the sh far away I saw you cried Frodo you were walking backwards and forwards the moon

          
          12:35:15
          Shone in your hair Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him it was only a dream said Frodo but it suddenly came back to me I'd quite forgotten it it came some time ago after I left the sh I think then it was late in coming said Gandalf as you will see I was in an evil plight and those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in such need and do not bear such Misfortune well Gandalf the Greg caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak

          
          12:35:56
          thread at first I feared as Saron no doubt intended that radagast had also Fallen yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at meeting if I had I should never have gone to Eisen guard or I should have gone more weily so Saran guessed and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger it would have been useless in any case to try and win over the honest rodigas to treachery he sought me in good faith and so persuaded me that was the undoing of saruman's plot for radagast knew no reason why he

          
          12:36:40
          should not do as I asked and he rode away towards merkwood where he had many friends of old and the Eagles of the mountains went far and wide and they saw many things the Gathering of wolves and the mustering Of Orcs And the nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands and they heard news of The Escape of Gollum and they sent a messenger to bring these Tidings to me so it was that when summer waned there came a of moon and gu here the windlord swiftest of the great Eagles came unlooked for to

          
          12:37:18
          orun and he found me standing on the Pinnacle then I spoke to him and he bore me away before San was aware I was far from Eisen guard a the wolves and Orcs issued from the gate to pursue me how far can you bear me I said to gu here many leagues said he but not to the ends of the Earth I was sent to Bear Tidings not burdens then I must have a steed on land I said and a steed surpassingly Swift but I have never had such a need of haste before then I will bear you to edoras where the Lord of Rohan sits in his

          
          12:38:01
          Halls he said well that is not very far off and I was glad for in the rmark of Rohan the roim the horse Lords dwell and there are no horses like those that are bred in that great Veil between the Misty Mountains in the white are the men of Rowan still to be trusted do you think I said to gu here for the treason of seron had shaken my faith they pay a tribute of horses he answered and send many yearly to Mordor or so it is said but they are not yet under the Yoke but if Saran has become evil as you say then

          
          12:38:42
          their Doom cannot be long delayed he set me down in the land of Rowan a Dawn and now I have lengthened my tail over long the rest must be more brief in Rohan I found evil already at work the lies of Saron and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings he B me take a horse and be gone and I chose one much to my liking but little to his I took the best horse in his land and I have never seen the like of him then he must be a noble Beast indeed said Aragon and it Grieves me more than many Tidings that might seem worse to

          
          12:39:22
          learn that saurin levies such tribute it was not so when last I was in that land nor is it now I will swear said bmir it's a lie that comes from the enemy I know the men of Rowan true and Valiant our allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago the Shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands answered Aragon Saran has fallen under it Rohan is beset who knows what you will find there if ever you return not this at least said bamir that they will buy their lives with horses they love their horses next to their kin and

          
          12:40:04
          not without reason for the horses of the ridar come from the fields of the north far from the Shadow and their race as that of their masters is descended from the free days of old true indeed said Gandalf and there is one among them that might have been fold in the morning of the world the horses of the nine cannot V with him tireless Swift as the flowing wind Shadow facts they called him by day his coat glistens like silver and by night it is like a shade and he passes unseen light is his footfall never before had any man

          
          12:40:44
          mounted him but I took him and I tamed him and so speedily he bore me that I reached the Sha when Frodo was on the barow Downs though I set out from Rohan only when he set out from hobon but fear grew in me as I rode ever as I came North I heard Tidings of the Riders and though I gained on them day by day they were ever before me they had divided their forces I learned some remained on the Eastern borders not far from the greenway and some invaded the sh from the south I came to hobbiton and Frodo had gone but I had words with

          
          12:41:24
          old gamji many words and few to the point he had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End I can't abide changes said he not at my time of life and least of all changes for the worst changes for the worst he repeated many times worst is a bad word I said to him and I hope you do not live to see it but amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left hobbiton less than a week before and that a black Horseman had come to the hill the same evening then I rode on in fear I came to

          
          12:42:02
          Buckland and found it in uproar as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick I came to the house at cric Hollow and it was broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo's then for a while hope left me and I did not wait to gather news or I might have been comforted but I rode on the trail of the Riders it was hard to follow for it went many ways and I was at a loss but it seemed to me that one or two had written towards Brie and that way I went for I

          
          12:42:38
          thought of words that might be said to the inkeeper butter B they call him thought I if this delay was his fault I will melt all the butter in him I will roast the old fool over a slow fire he expected no less and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot what did you do to him cried Frodo in alarm he was really very kind to us and did all that he could Gandalf laughed don't be afraid he said I didn't bite and I barked very little so Overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of him when he stopped quicking

          
          12:43:18
          that I embraced the old fellow how it happened I could not then guess but I learned that you had been in breath the night before and had gone off that morning with Strider Strider I cried shouting for Joy yes sir I'm afraid so sir said butterbar mistaking me he got at them in spite of all the I could do and they took up with him they behaved very queer all the time they were here willful you might say ass fool Thrice worthy and beloved bman said I it's the best news I've had since Midsummer it's worth a gold piece at the

          
          12:43:56
          least may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing Excellence for seven years said I now I can take a night's rest the first since I have forgotten when so I stayed there that night wondering much what had become of the riders for only of two had there yet been any news in Bri it seemed but in the night we heard more five at least came from the west and they threw down the gates and passed through Brie like a howling wind and the Brie folk were still shivering and expecting the end of

          
          12:44:31
          the world I got up Before Dawn and went after them I don't know but it seems clear to me that this is what happened their Captain remained in secret away South the Bri while two rode ahead through the village and four more invaded the Sha but when these were foiled in Bri and at cric Hollow they returned to their Captain with Tidings and so left the road unguarded for a while except by the spies the captain then sent some Eastward straight across country and he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wroth I

          
          12:45:08
          galloped to where the top like a gale and I reached it before Sundown on my second day from brie and they were there before me they drew away from me for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the sun was in the sky but they closed round at night and I was besieged at the hilltop in the old ring of Amon I was hard put to it indeed such light and Flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the war beacons of old at Sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north I could not hope to do more it

          
          12:45:47
          was impossible to find you Frodo in the wilderness and it would have been Folly to try with all the nine at my heels so I had to trust to Aragorn but I hoped to draw some of them off and yet reach rivendel ahead of you and send out help four Riders did indeed follow me but they turned back after a while and made for the Ford it seems that helped a little for there were only five not nine when your Camp was attacked I reached here at Last by a long hard Road up the horwell and through the etan Moores and down from

          
          12:46:22
          the north it took me nearly 14 days from weathertop for I could not ride among the rocks of the troll fs and shadows departed I sent him back to his master but a great friendship has grown between us and if I have need he will come my call but so it was that I came to rivendel only 3 days before the ring and the news of its Peril had already been brought here which proved well indeed and that Frodo is the end of my account May elrond and the others forgive the length of it but such a thing has not happened before that

          
          12:46:59
          Gandalf broke trist and did not come when he promised an account to the ring bearer of so strange an event was required I think well the tale is now told From First to Last here we all are and here is the ring but we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose what shall we do with it there was silence at last Elon spoke again this is Grievous news concerning Saran he said for we trusted him and he is deep in all our counsels it is perilous to stud too deeply the Arts of the enemy for good or for ill for such

          
          12:47:43
          Falls and betrayals alas have happened before of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me I have known few Hobbits save Bilbo here and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him the world has changed much since I was last on the westward roads the bow whites We Know by many names and of the Old Forest many tales have been told all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern March time was when a squirrel could go

          
          12:48:19
          from tree to tree from what is now the Sha to dunland west of Eisen guard in those lands I journeyed once and many things wild and strange I knew but I had forgotten Bombadil if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and Hills long ago and even then was older than the old that was not not then his name y Berard we called him oldest and fatherless but many another name he has since been given by other folk forn by the dwarves oral by Northern men and other names besides he is a strange

          
          12:48:56
          creature but maybe I should have summoned him to our Council he would not have come said Gandalf could we not send messages to him and obtain his help asked aresto it seemed seems that he has a power even over the ring no I should not put it so said Gandalf say rather that the ring has no power over him he is his own Master but he cannot alter the ring itself nor break its power over others and now he is withdrawn into a little land within bounds that he has set though none can see them waiting perhaps

          
          12:49:33
          for a change of days and he will not Step Beyond them but within these bounds nothing seems to dismay him said Aristo would he not take the ring and keep it there forever harmless no said Gandalf not willingly he might do so if all the free folk of the world begged him but he would not understand the need and if he were given the ring he would soon forget it or most likely throw it away such things have no hold on his mind he would be a most unsafe guardian and that alone is answer enough but in any case said glorfindel to send

          
          12:50:13
          the ring to him would only postpone the day of evil he is far away we could not now take it back to him unguessed unmarked by any spy and even if we could soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it could that power be defied by Bombadil alone I think not I think that in the end if all else is conquered bomb still will fall last as he was first and then night will come I know little of a Wayne save the name said galdor but gfle I think is

          
          12:50:51
          right power to defy our enemy is not in him unless such power is in the Earth itself and yet we see that sour and can torture and destroy the very Hills what power Still Remains lies with us here in imladris or with kydan at the Havens or in lauan but have they the strength have we here the strength to withstand the enemy the coming of saurin at the last when all else is overthrown I have not the strength said Eland neither have they then if a ring cannot be kept from him Forever by strength said glorfindel two things only

          
          12:51:31
          remain for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it but Gandalf is revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess said Eland and they who dwell Beyond the Sea would not receive it for good or ill it belongs to Middle Earth it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it then said glorfindel let us cast it into the deeps and so make the lies of Saran come true for it is clear now that even at the council his feet were already on a crooked path he knew that

          
          12:52:07
          the ring was not lost forever but wished us to think so for he began to lust for it for himself yet of in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe not safe forever said Gandalf there are many things in the Deep Waters and seas and lands may change and it is not our part here to take thought only for the season or for a few lives of men or for the passing age of the world we should seek a final end of this Menace even if we do not hope to make one and that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea said galdor if the

          
          12:52:47
          return to I be thought too dangerous then flight to the sea is now fraught with gravest Peril my heart tells me that Sauron will expect us to take the Western way when he learns what has befallen he soon will the nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respit here they find new steeds and Swift fter only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him and a March in power along the coasts into the North and if he comes Asing the white towers and the Havens Hereafter the elves may have no

          
          12:53:22
          escape from the lengthening Shadows of Middle Earth long yet will that March be delayed said Boromir Gondor wains you say but Gondor stands and even the end of its strength is still very strong and yet it's vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor and other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard then said Aristo there are but two causes as glor findle already has declared to hide the ring forever or to unmake it but both are beyond our power who will read this riddle for us none

          
          12:54:04
          here can do so said elrond Gravely at least none can forell what will come to pass if we take this road or that but it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take the westward Road seems easiest therefore it must be shunned it will be watched too often the elves have fled that way now at this last we must take a hard Road a road unforeseen there lies our hope if hope it be to walk into pedal to Mordor we must send the ring to the fire silence fell again Frodo even in that fair house looking out upon a

          
          12:54:49
          sunlit valley filled with a noise of clear waters felt a dead darkness in his heart Boromir stirred and Frodo looked at him he was fingering his Great Horn and frowning at length he spoke I do not understand all this he said San is a traitor but did he not have a glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hiding and destroying why should we not think that the great Ring has come into our hands to serve Us in the very hour of need wielding it the free Lords of the free May surely defeat the enemy that is what he most fears I

          
          12:55:28
          deem the men of Gondor are Valiant and they will never submit but they may be beaten down Val needs first strength and then a weapon let the ring be your weapon if it has such a power as you say take it and go forth to Victory alas no said Eland we cannot use the rolling ring that we now know too well it belongs to saurin and was made by him alone and is altogether evil its strength Boromir is too great for anyone to wield at will save only those who have already a great power of Their Own but for them it holds an even

          
          12:56:10
          deadlier Peril the very desire of it corrupts the heart consider Saran if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor using his own Arts he would then set himself on sauron's throne and yet another dark lord would appear and that is another reason why the ring should be destroyed as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the wise for nothing is evil in the beginning even sain was not so I fear to take the ring to hide it I will not take the ring to wield it nor I

          
          12:56:51
          said Gandalf borom looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head so be it he said then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have and at the least while the wise ones guard this ring we will fight on maybe the sword that was broken may still stem the tide if the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom only but the senors of the kings of men who can tell said Aragon but we will put it to the test one day May the day not be too long delayed said barir for though I do not ask for Aid we need it

          
          12:57:33
          it would comfort us to know that others fought also with all the means that they have then be comforted said Eland for there are other powers and Realms that you know not and they hidden from you and when the Great flows past many Shores here it comes to argonath and the gates of Gondor still it might be well for all said gloin the dwarf if all these strengths were joined and the powers of each were used in League are rings there may be less treacherous that might be used in our need the seven are lost to

          
          12:58:12
          us if barlan has not found the Ring of th which was the last not has been heard of it since th perished in Moria indeed I may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that barlin went away barlin will find no ring in Moria said Gandalf th gave it to thin his son but not thin to Thorin it was taken with torment from thin in the dungeons of do gor I came too late ah alas said gloin when will the day come of our revenge but still there are the three what of the three rings of the elves very Mighty Rings it is said

          
          12:58:58
          do not the elf Lords keep them yet they too were made by the dark lord long ago are they idle I see elf Lords here will they not say The eles Returned no answer did you not hear me gloin said Elon the three were not made by Sauron nor did he ever touch them but of them it is not permitted to speak so much only in this hour of doubt I may now say they are not idle but they were not made as weapons of war or Conquest that is not their power those who made them did not desire strength or domination or

          
          12:59:42
          hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to preserve all things unstained these things the elves of Middle Earth have in some measure gained though with sorrow but all that has been wrought by those who wield the three will turn to their undoing and their minds and hearts will become revealed to saon if he regains the one it would be better if the three had never been that is his purpose but what then would happen if the ruling ring were destroyed as you councel asked Lan we know not for certain answered

          
          13:00:19
          Elon sadly some hope that the three rings which saon has never touched would then become free and their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought but maybe when the one has gone the three will fail and many Fair things will fade and be forgotten that is my belief yet all the elves are willing to endure this chance said glorfindel If by it the power of Sauron may be broken and the fear of his Dominion be taken away forever thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring said Aristo and yet we come no

          
          13:01:00
          nearer what strength of we for the finding of the fire in which it was made that is the path of despair of folly I should say if the long wisdom of el Rond did not forbid me despair or Folly said Gandalf it is not despair for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt we do not it is wisdom to recognize necessity when all other caes have been weighed though as Folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope well let Folly be our cloak a veil before the eyes of the enemy for he is very wise

          
          13:01:40
          and weighs all things to a nicy in the scales of his malice but the only measure that he knows his desire desire for power and so he judges all hearts into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it that having the Ring We may seek to destroy it if we seek this we shall put him out of Reckoning at least for a while said elrond the Drone Ro must be trod but it will be very hard and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it this Quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong yet such

          
          13:02:21
          is of the course of Deeds that move the wheels of the world small hands do them because they must while the eyes of the greater are elsewhere very well very well Master Elrod said Bilbo suddenly say no more it's plain enough what you're pointing at billbo the silly Hobbit started this affair and billbo had better finish it or himself I was very comfortable here and getting on with my book if you want to know I'm just writing an ending for it I had thought of putting and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of

          
          13:03:01
          his days it's a good ending and none the worse for having been used before now I shall have to alter that it doesn't look like coming true and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters if I live to write them it's a frightful nuisance when ought I to start Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo but the laughter died on his lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old Hobbit with grave respect only gloen smiled but his smile came from old memories oh of course my dear Bilbo said

          
          13:03:41
          Gandalf if you had really started this affair you might be expected to finish it but you know well enough now that starting is too great a claim for any and that only a small part is played in great Deeds by any hero you need not bow though the word was meant and we do not doubt that under justest you are making a valiant offer but one beyond your strength Bilbo you you cannot take this thing it has passed on if you need my advice any longer I should say that your part is ended unless as a recorder

          
          13:04:18
          finish your book and leave the ending unaltered there is still hope for it but get ready to write a sequel when they come back Bilbo laughed I've never known you give me Pleasant advice before he said as all your unpleasant advice has been good I wonder if this advice is not bad still I don't suppose I have the strength or luck left to deal with the ring it's grown and I have not but tell me what do you mean by they The Messengers who are sent with the ring exactly and who are they to be that seems to me what this Council has

          
          13:05:00
          to decide and all that it has to decide elves May thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure great weirdness but I'm only an old Hobbit and I miss my meal at noon can't you think of some names now or put it off till after dinner no one answered the noon bell rang still no one spoke Frodo glanced at all the faces but they were not turned to him all the council sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thought a great dread fell on him as if he was awaiting the pron announcement of some Doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might

          
          13:05:43
          after all never be spoken an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at Peace by Bilbo's side in rivendel filled all his heart at last with an effort he spoke and wandered to hear his own words as if some other will was using his Small Voice I will take the ring he said though I do not know the way elron raised his eyes and looked at him and Frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance if I understand or right all that I have heard he said I think that this task is appointed for you Frodo and that if you

          
          13:06:26
          do not find a way no one will this is the hour of the sh folk when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and councils of the great who who of all the wise could have foreseen it or if they are wise why should they expect to know it until the ey has struck but it is a heavy burden so heavy that none could lay it on another I do not lay it on you but if you take it freely I will say that your choice is right and though all the mighty elf friends of old Hardo and hurin and Turin and baron himself were assembled

          
          13:07:07
          together your seat should be among them but you won't send him off alone surely Master cried Sam unable to contain himself any longer and jumping up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor no indeed said elron turning towards him with a smile you at least shall go with him it is hardly possible to separate you from him even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not Sam sat down blushing and muttering a nice pickle we've landed ourselves in Mr Frodo he said shaking his

          
          13:07:48
          head chapter three the ring goes south later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo's room Mary and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the council and had been chosen as Frodo's companion it's most unfair said Pippen instead of throwing him out and clapping him in Chains elron goes and rewards him for his cheek rewards said Frodo I can't imagine a more severe punishment you're not thinking what you're saying condemned to go on this hopeless Journey a reward yesterday I dreamed that my

          
          13:08:28
          task was done and I could rest here a long while perhaps for good I don't wonder said Mary and I wish you could but where envying Sam not you if you have to go then it will be a punishment for any of us to be left behind even in rendel we've come a long way with you and been through some stiff times we want to go on that's what I meant said Pippen we Hobbits ought to stick together and we will I shall go unless they chain me there must be someone with intelligence in the party then you certainly will not be chosen pigin to

          
          13:09:08
          said Gandalf looking in through the window which was near the ground but you're all worrying yourselves unnecessarily nothing is decided yet nothing decided cried Pippen then what were you all doing you were shut up for hours talking said Bilbo there was a deal of talk and everyone had an eye opener even old Gandalf I think legolas's bit of news about Gollum caught even him on the Hop though he passed it off you were wrong said Gandalf you were inattentive I had already heard of it from gu here if you

          
          13:09:47
          want to know the only real eye openers as you put it were you and Frodo and I was the only one that was not surprised well anyway said Bilbo nothing was decided Beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam I was afraid all the time that it might come to that if I was let off but if you ask me El Rond will send out a fair number when the reports come in have they started yet Gandalf yes said the wizard some of the Scouts have been sent out already more will go tomorrow elron is sending elves and they will get in touch with the

          
          13:10:27
          Rangers and maybe with Ron du's folk in merkwood and Aragorn has gone with elon's sons we shall have to scar the lands all around for many long leagues before any move is made so cheer up Frodo you'll probably make quite a long stay here ah said Sam gloomily we'll just wait long enough for winter to come that can't be helped said Bilbo it's your fault partly Frodo mad insisting on waiting for my birthday a funny way of honoring it I can't help thinking not the day I should have chosen for letting the SBS into bagg

          
          13:11:07
          again but there it is you can't wait now till spring and you can't go till the reports come back when winter first begins to bite and stones crack in the frosty night when pools are black and trees are bear is evil in the wild to fair but that I'm afraid will be just your luck I'm afraid it will said Gandalf we can't start until we found out about the Riders I thought they were all destroyed in the flood said Mary you can't destroy ring raids like that said Gandalf the power of their Master is in them and they stand or fall

          
          13:11:50
          by him we hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and so made for a while less dangerous but we must find out for certain in the meantime you should try and forget your troubles Frodo I don't know if I can do anything to help you but I will whisper this in your ear someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party he was right I think I shall come with you so great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window sill where he had been sitting and took off his hat and bowed I only

          
          13:12:25
          said I think I should come do not count on anything yet in this matter elron will have much to say and your friend The Strider which reminds me I want to see elrond I must be off how long do you think I shall have here said froa to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone oh I don't know I can't count days in rivendale said Bilbo but quite long I should think we can have many a good talk what about helping me with my book and making a start on the next have you thought of an ending yes several and all are dark and

          
          13:13:04
          unpleasant said Frodo oh that won't do said Bilbo books ought to have good endings how would this do and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after it will do well if it ever comes to that said Frodo ah said Sam and where will they live that's what I often wonder for a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the pedals that lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land of rivendel that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds the future

          
          13:13:44
          good or ill was not forgotten but ceased to have any power over the present health and hope grew strong in them and they were content with each good day as it came taking pleasure in every meal and in every word and song so the day slipped away as each morning dawned bright and fair and each evening followed cool and clear but Autumn was waning fast slowly the Golden Light faded to pale silver and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees a wind began to blow Chill from the Misty Mountains to the east the

          
          13:14:21
          Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky and put to flight all the Lesser stars but low in the South one star Shone red every night as the moon waned again it Shone brighter and brighter Frodo could see it from his window deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of Eland and November had gone by with the last shreds of Autumn and December was passing when the scouts began to return some had gone North Beyond The

          
          13:15:01
          Springs of the whw into the etan Moores the others had gone west and with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the grey flood as far as thed where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined Town many had gone east and south and some of these had crossed the mountains and entered merkwood While others had climbed the pass at the source of the gladen river and had come down into wilderland and over the gladen fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at cros

          
          13:15:39
          goel radagast was not there and they had returned over the high pass that was called the diil stair the sons of Elon El Adan and eler were the last to return they had made a great journey passing down the Silver Load into a strange country but of their errand they would not speak to any save to elund in no region had the messengers discovered any signs or Tidings of the riders or other Servants of the enemy even from the Eagles of the Misty Mountains they had learned no fresh news nothing had been seen or heard of Gollum

          
          13:16:18
          but the wild wolves were still Gathering and were hunting again far up the Great River three of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded Ford on the rocks of the Rapids below it searches discovered the bodies of five more and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered of the Black Riders no other Trace was to be seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt it seemed that they had vanished from the north eight out of the nine are accounted for at least said Gandalf it is rash to be too sure yet I think that

          
          13:16:55
          we may hope now that the ring raids were scattered and have been obliged to return as best they could to their master in Mordor empty and shipless if if that is so it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again of course the enemy has other servants but they will have to Journey all the way to the borders of rivendel before they can pick up our Trail and if we are careful that will be hard to find but we must delay no more Elon summoned the Hobbits to him he looked Gravely at Frodo the time has come he said if the

          
          13:17:36
          ring is to set up out it must go soon but those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or Force they must pass into the domain of the enemy far from Aid you still hold to your word Frodo that you will be the ring bearer I do said Frodo I will go with Sam then I cannot help you much not even with counsel said Elon I can foresee very little of your road and how your task is to be achieved I do not know the shadow has crept now to the feet of the mountains and it draws nigh even to the

          
          13:18:16
          borders of gry flood and under the shadow all is dark to me you will meet many foes some open and some disguised and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it I will send out messages such as I can contrive to Those whom I know in the wide world but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry or come no quicker than you yourself and I will choose your companions to go with you as far as they will or Fortune allows the number Must Be Few since your hope is in speed and

          
          13:18:53
          secrecy had I a host of elves in armor of the Elder days it would Avail little save to arouse the power of M door the company of the Ring shall be nine and the nine Walkers shall be set against the nine riders that are evil with you and your faithful servant gandel will go for this shall be his great task and may be the end of his labors for the rest they shall represent the other free peoples of the world elves dwarves and Men Legolas shall be for the elves and gim son of gloin for the dwarves they are willing to go at

          
          13:19:34
          least to the passes of the mountains and make baby beyond for men you shall have Aragorn son of arathor for the ring of isor concerns him closely Strider said Frodo yes he said with a smile I ask leave once again to be your companion Frodo I would have begged you to come said Frodo only I thought you were going to Min tith with Bor I am said Aragon and the soul that was broken shall be reforged a I set out to war but your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles therefore bmir will also be in the

          
          13:20:17
          company he's a valiant man there remain two more to be found said elrond these I will consider of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send but that will leave no place for us cried Pippen in dismay we don't want to be left behind we want to go with Frodo that is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead said Eland neither does Frodo said Gandalf unexpectedly supporting pipid nor do any of us see clearly it is true that if these Hobbits understood the danger they

          
          13:20:59
          would not dare to go but they would still wish to go oh wish that they dared and be shamed and unhappy I think Elon that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom even if you chose for us an elf Lord such as glorfindel he could not storm The Dark Tower nor open the road to the fire by the power that is in him you speak Gravely said Eland but I am in doubt the Sha I forbode is not free now from Peril and these two I had thought to send back there as Messengers to do what they

          
          13:21:39
          could according to the fashion of their country to warn the people of their danger in any case I judge that the younger of these two perigrine toque should remain my heart is against his going then Master elron you will have to lock me in prison or send me home tied in a sack said Pippen for otherwise I shall follow the company let it be so then you shall go said El R and he side now the tale of nine is filled in seven days the company must depart the sword of Al lendel was forged a new by Elish Smiths and on its blade

          
          13:22:21
          was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent moon and the raid sun and about them was written many runes for Aragorn son of arthorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor very bright was that sword when it was made whole again the light of the sun Shone rly in it and the light of the Moon Shone cold and its Edge was hard and keen and Aragon gave it a new name and called it anduril flame of the West Aragon and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their Road and the pedals they would meet and they pondered

          
          13:23:00
          the stored and figured maps and books of law that were in the house of elod sometimes fro was with them but he was content to lean on their guidance and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo in those last days The Hobbit sat together in the evening in the Hall of far and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Baron and Luan and the winning of the great Jewel but in the day while Mary and Pippen were out and about Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small

          
          13:23:34
          room then Bilbo would read passages from his book which still seemed very incomplete or scraps of his verses or would take notes of Frodo's Adventures on the morning of the last day froda was alone with Bilbo and the old Hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box he lifted the lid and fumbled inside here is your sword he said but it was broken you know I took it to keep it safe but I forgotten to ask if the Smiths could mend it no time now so I thought perhaps you'd care to have this don't you know he took from the box

          
          13:24:12
          a small sword in an old shabby Leen scabbo then he drew it and its polished and well tendered blade glittered suddenly cold and bright this is Sting he said and thrust it with little effort deep into a wooden beam take it if you like I sh want it again I expect Frodo accepted it gratefully oh also there is this said Bilbo bringing out a parcel which seemed to be rather heavy for its size he Unwound several folds of old cloth and held up a small shirt of mail it was close woven of many rings as Supple almost as linen cold as ice and

          
          13:24:56
          harder than steel it Shone like moonlit silver and was studded with white gems with it was a belt of Pearl and Crystal it's a pretty isn't it said Bilbo moving it in the light and useful it's my dwarf mail that Thorin gave me I got it back from Mel delving before I started and packed it with my luggage I brought all the momentos of my journey away with me except the ring but I didn't expect to use this and I don't need it now except to look at it sometimes you hardly feel any weight when you put it on

          
          13:25:36
          I should look well I don't think I should look right in it said Frodo just what I said myself said Bilbo but never mind about looks you can wear it under your outer clothes come on you must share this secret with me don't tell anybody else but I should feel happier if I knew you were wearing it I have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black Riders he ended in a low voice very well well I'll take it said Frodo Bilbo put it on him and fastened sting upon the glittering belt and then Frodo put over the top his old weather

          
          13:26:16
          stained britches tunic and jacket just a plain Hobbit you look said Bilbo but there is more about you now than appears on the surface good luck to you he turned away and looked out of the windows trying to hum a tune I can't thank you as I should to Bilbo for this and for all your past kindnesses said Frodo don't try said the old Hobbit turning around and slapping him on the back ow he cried you're too hard now to slap but there you are Hobbits must stick together and especially bagginses all I ask in return

          
          13:26:58
          is take as much care of yourself as you can and bring back all the news you can and any old songs and tales you come by I'll do my best to finish my book before you return I should like to write the second book if I'm spared he broke off and turned to the window again singing softly I sit beside the fire and think of all that I have seen of me flowers and butterflies in some that have been of yellow leaves and Gos in autumns that there were with Morning Mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair I sit beside the fire and think of

          
          13:28:03
          how the world will be when winter comes without a spring that I shall ever see for still there are so many things that I have never seen in every W in every spring there is a different green I sit beside the fire and think of people long ago of people who will see a world that I shall never know but all the while I sit and think of times there were before I listen for turning feet and voices at the door it was a cold gray day near the end of December the East Wind was streaming through the bare branches of the trees

          
          13:29:19
          and seething in the dark Pines on the Hills ragged clouds were hurrying overhead dark and low as the cheerless Shadows of the early evening began to fall the company made ready to set out they were to start at dusk for elund counseled them to Journey under cover of night as often as they could until they were far from rivendel you should fear the many eyes of the Servants of saurin he said I do not doubt that news of the discomfort of the Riders has already reached him and he will be filled with

          
          13:29:57
          wroth soon now his spies on foot and Wing will be abroad in the northern lands even of the sky above you must bew as you go on your way the company took little gear of War for their Hope was in secrecy not in battle Aragon had anduril but no other weapon and he went forth clad only in Rusty green and brown as a ranger of the Wilderness Boromir had a long sword in fashion like andural but of less lineage and he bore also a shield and his war horn loud and clear it sounds in The Valleys of the hills he

          
          13:30:38
          said and then let all the foes of Gondor flee putting it to his lips he blew a blast and The Echoes leapt from rock to rock and all that heard that voice in rivendel sprang to their feet slow should you be to wind that horn again Boromir said Elon until you stand once more on the borders of your land and D need is on you maybe said said bmir but always I've let my horn cry at setting forth and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows I will not go forth as a thief in the night kimly the dwarf alone wore openly

          
          13:31:21
          a short shirt of steel rings for dwarves make light of burdens and in his belt was a broad bladed axe Legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his belt a long white knife the younger Hobbit the swords that they had taken from the batt but Frodo took only sting and his mail coat as bilbur wished remained hidden Gandalf bore his staff but Girt at his side was the Elven sword glamdring the mate of orist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain all were well furnished by Elon with thick warm clothes and they had

          
          13:32:06
          jackets and cloaks lined with fur spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were Laden on a pony none other than the poor Beast that they had brought from brie the stay in Rivendell had worked a great Wonder of change on him he was glossy and seemed to have the Vigor of Youth it was Sam who had insisted on choosing him declaring that bill as he called him would Pine if he didn't come that animal can nearly talk he said and would talk if he stayed here much longer he gave me a look as plain as Mr Pippen

          
          13:32:47
          could speak it if you don't let me go with you Sam I'll follow on my own so bill was going as the Beast of Burden yet he was the only member of the company that didn't seem depressed their farewells had been said in the Great Hall by the father and they were only waiting now for Gandalf who hadn't yet come out of the house a gleam of Fire Light Came From the open doors and soft lights were glowing in many windows Bilbo huddled in the cloak stood silent on the door step beside Frodo Aragon sat with his head bowed to

          
          13:33:26
          his knees only Elon knew fully what this AR meant to him the others could be seen as gray shapes in the Darkness Sam was standing by the pony sucking his teeth and staring moodily into the Gloom Where the River roared stonily below his desire for adventure was at its lowest e Bill my lad he said you oughtn't to have took up with us you could have stayed here and at the best hay till a new grass comes Bill swished his tail and said nothing Sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went over anxiously in his

          
          13:34:07
          mind all the things that he had stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten anything his chief treasure his cooking gear and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could a good supply of pip weed but not near enough I'll warrant flint and Tinder Woolen hose linen various small belongings of his Masters that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out into Triumph when they were called for he went through them all rope he muttered no rope and only last night you said to yourself Sam what

          
          13:34:46
          about a bit of rope you'll want it if you haven't got it well I'll want it I can't get it now at that moment El Rond came out with Gandalf and he called the company to him this is my last word he said in a low voice the ring ring bearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom on him alone is any charge laid neither to Cast Away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it save members of the company and the council and only then in gravest need the others go with him as

          
          13:35:27
          free companions to help him on his way you may t or come back or turn aside into other paths as chance allows the further you go the less easy will it be to withdraw yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further than you will for you do not yet know the strength of your hearts and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimy maybe said Eland but let him not vow to walk in the dark who has not seen the Nightfall yet sworn word may strengthen

          
          13:36:10
          quaking heart said gimy or Break It said Eland look not too far ahead but go now with good Hearts farewell and may the blessing of elves and men and all free folk go with you may the stars shine upon your faces good good luck cried Bilbo stuttering with a cold I don't suppose you would be able to keep a diary fro the mad but I shall expect a full account when you get back and don't be too long farewell many others of elon's household stood in the shadows and watched them go bidding them farewell with soft voices

          
          13:36:53
          there was no laughter and no song or music at last they turned away and Faded silently into the dusk they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep path paths that led out of the cloven veil of rivendel and they came at length to the high Moore where the wind hissed through the Heather then with one glance at the last homely house twinkling below them they stroe away far into the night at the Ford of bruinen they left the road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded

          
          13:37:33
          lands their purpose was to hold this course west of the mountains for many miles and days the country was much rougher and more Barren than in the green veil of the Great River in wilderland on the other side of the range and their going would be slow but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes the spies of saurin had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country and the paths were little known except to the people of rivendel Gandalf walked in front and with him went arod who knew the land

          
          13:38:09
          even in the dark the others were in file behind and Legolas whose eyes were Keen was the rear guard the first part of their Journey was hard and dreary and Frodo remembered little of it save the wind for many sunless days an icy blast came from the mountains in the East and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching fingers though the company was well clad they seldom felt warm either moving or at rest they slept uneasily during the middle of the day in some Hollow of the land or hidden under the Tangled Thorn

          
          13:38:45
          bushes that grew in thickets in many places in the late afternoon they were roused by the watch and took their Chief meal cold and cheerless as a rule for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire in the evening they went on again always as nearly Southward as they could find a way at first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they were weary they were creeping forward like snails and getting nowhere each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before yet steadily

          
          13:39:22
          the mountains were drawing nearer south of rivendel they Rose even higher and bent westwards and about the feet of the main range there was tumbled an even wider land of Bleak Hills and deep valleys filled with turbulent Waters paths were few and winding and led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swamps they had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed the wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the South the Swift flowing clouds lifted and melted away and the sun came

          
          13:40:00
          out pale and bright there came a cold clear Dawn at the end of a long stumbling night March The Travelers reached a low Ridge crowned with ancient Holly trees whose gray green trunks seemed to have been built out of the very Stone of the hills their dark leaves Shawn and their berries glowed red in the light of the Rising Sun away in the South Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the company was taking at the left of this high range Rose Three Peaks the tallest and nearest

          
          13:40:39
          stood up like a tooth tipped with snow its great bare Northern precipice was still largely in the shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red Gandalf stood at Frodo's side and looked out under his hand we have done well he said we've reached the borders of the country that men call Hollen many elves lived here in happier days when a Regan was its name five and 40 leaves as of the crow fly we've come though many long miles further our feet have walked the land and the weather will be milder now but

          
          13:41:21
          perhaps all the more dangerous dangerous or not a real Sunrise is mighty welcome said Frodo throwing back his hood and letting the Morning Light fall on his face but the mountains are ahead of us said Pippen we must have turned eastwards in the night no said Gandalf but you see further ahead in the clear light Beyond those Peaks the range bends round Southwest there are many maps in elon's house but I suppose you never thought to look at them yes I did sometimes said Pippen but I don't remember them Frodo has a better head

          
          13:42:03
          for that sort of thing I need no map said gimy who had come up with Legolas and was gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes there is the land where our fathers worked of old and we have wrought the image of those mountains into many works of metal and stone and into many songs and tales they stand tall in our dreams baraz zerak shur only once before have I seen them from afar in Waking Life but I know them and their names for under them lies kard Doom the dwelf that is now called The Black Pit

          
          13:42:50
          Moria in the Elish tongue Yonder stands barimba the red horn cruel kathas and Beyond him a silver teen and cloudy head cbil the white and FAL the gray that we call Zer zigel and bath there the Misty Mountains divide and between their arms lies the Deep shadowed Valley which we cannot forget as an bizar the diale which the elves call nandon it is for the diil Dale that we are making said Gandalf if we climb the that pass that is called the red horn gate Under The Far Side of kathas we shall come down by

          
          13:43:41
          the diil stair into the deep veil of the dwarves there lies the miroir and there the river silverload rises in its icy Springs dark is the water of Ked zaram said gim and cold are the Springs of Kila my heart trembles at the thought that I may see them soon May you have joy at the sight my good dwarf said Gandalf but whatever you may do we at least cannot stay in that Valley we must go down the silverload into the secret woods and sew to the Great River and then he paused yes and where then asked

          
          13:44:24
          Mary to the end of the journey in the end said Gandalf we cannot look too far ahead let us be glad that the first stage is safely open over I think we will rest here not only today but tonight as well there is a wholesome air about hauling much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the elves if once they dwelt there that is true said Legolas but the elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silven folk and the trees and the grass do not now remember them only I hear the stones

          
          13:45:04
          lament them deep they delved us Fair they rought us high they builded us but they are gone they are gone they sought the Havens long ago that morning they lit a fire in a deep Hollow shrouded by great bushes of Holly and their supper breakfast was merer than it had been since they set out they didn't hurry to bed afterwards for they expected to have all the night to sleep in and they didn't mean to go on again again until the evening of the next day only Aragorn was silent and Restless after a while he left the

          
          13:45:43
          company and wandered on to the ridge there he stood in the shadow of a tree looking out southwards and westwards with his head posed as if he was listening then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the others laughing and talking what's the matter Strider Mary called up what are you looking for do you miss the East Wind no indeed he answered but I miss something I've been in the country of Holland in many seasons no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live here at all times

          
          13:46:23
          especially Birds yet now all things but you are silent I can feel it there is no sound from Miles about us and your voices seem to make the ground ech I don't understand it Gandalf looked up with sudden interest but what do you guess is the reason he asked is there more in it than surprise at seeing four Hobbits not to mention the rest of us where people are so seldom seen or heard I hope that's it answered Aragon but I have a sense of watchfulness and of fear that I have never had here before then we must be more careful said

          
          13:47:07
          Gandalf if you bring a Ranger with you it's well to pay attention to him especially if the ranger is Aragon we must stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch it was Sam's turn that day to take the first watch but Aragorn joined him the others fell asleep then the silence grew until even Sam felt it the breathing of the sleepers be plainly heard the swish of the pony's tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises Sam could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred Dead

          
          13:47:47
          Silence was around him and over all hung a clear blue sky as the sun rode up from the East away in the South a dark patch appeared and grew and drove North like flying smoke in the wind what that Strider he don't look like a cloud said Sam in a whisper ER to Aragorn he made no answer he was gazing intently at the sky but before long Sam could see for himself what was approaching flocks of birds flying at great speed were wheeling and circling and traversing all the land as if they were searching for something and they

          
          13:48:24
          were steadily drawing nearer lie flat and still he stor pulling Sam down into the shade of a holly bush for a whole Regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main host and came flying low straight towards the ridge Sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size as they passed overhead in so dense a throng that their Shadow followed them Darkly over the ground below one harsh croak Was Heard not until they had dwindled into the distance north and west and the sky was again clear with Aragon rise then he

          
          13:49:03
          sprang up and went and wakened gandal regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the mountains and the gray flood he said and they've passed over Holland they are not natives here they are craine out of fangorn and dunland I do not know what they are about possibly there is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing but I think they're spying out the land I've also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky I think we ought to move again this evening Holland is no longer wholesome

          
          13:49:40
          for us it is being watched and in that case so is the red horn gate said Gandalf and how we can get over that without being seen I can't imagine but we will think of that when we must as for moving as soon as it's dark I'm afraid that you are right luckily our fire made little smoke and it burned low before the craine came said Aragon it must be put out and not lit again well if that isn't a plague and a nuisance said Pippen the news no far and a move again by night had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the late

          
          13:50:23
          afternoon oh because of a pack of crows I looked forward to a real good meal tonight something hot well you can go on looking forward said Alf there may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you for myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet however we're certain of one thing at any rate it will get warmer as we get South too warm I shouldn't Wonder muttered Sam toodo but I'm beginning to think it's time we got a sight of that fiery mountain and saw the end of the road so to speak I thought at first that

          
          13:51:02
          this here red horn or whatever it's name is might be it till gimle spoke his piece a fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be Maps conveyed nothing to Sam's mind and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his Reckoning all that day the company remained in hiding the dark Birds passed over now and again but as the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwards at dusk the company set out and turning now half East they steered their course towards kathas which far

          
          13:51:41
          away still glowed faintly red in the last Light of the vanished Sun one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded Guided by Aragon they struck a good path it looked to Frodo like the remains of an ancient road that had once been Broad and well planned from Holland to the mountain pass the Moon now at the full Rose over the mountains and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black many of them looked to have been worked by hands though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak

          
          13:52:18
          baren land it was the cold chill hour before the first Stir of Dawn and the moon was low Frodo looked up at the sky suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again he shivered did you see anything pass over he whisper to Gandalf who was just ahead no but I felt it whatever it was he answered it may be nothing only a whisp of thin Cloud it was moving fast then muttered Aragon and not with the wind nothing further happened that night

          
          13:53:02
          the next morning dawned even brighter than before but the air was chill again already the wind was turning back towards the east for two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but ever more slowly as the road wound up into the hills and the mountains towered up nearer and nearer on the third morning kathas Rose before them a mighty Peak tipped with snow like silver but with sheer naked sides dull red as if stained with blood there was a black look in the sky and the sun was one the wind had gone now

          
          13:53:40
          round to the Northeast Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back winter deepens behind us he said quietly to Aragon the heights away North are whiter than they were snow is lying far down their shoulders tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the red horn gate we may well be seen by Watchers on that narrow path and way laid by some evil but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any what do you think of your course now Aragorn Frodo overheard these words and understood that Gandalf and Aragon were

          
          13:54:19
          continuing some debate that had begun long before he listened anxiously I think no good of our course from beginning to end as you know well Gandalf answered Aragorn and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on on but we must go on and it's no good our delaying the passage of the mountains further south there are no passes till one comes to the Gap of Rohan I don't trust that way since your news of Saron who knows which side now the marshals of the horse Lord serve who knows indeed said Gandalf but there is

          
          13:54:58
          another way and not by the pass of kathos the dark and secret way that we have spoken of but let us not speak of it again not yet say nothing to the others I beg not until it's plain that there is no other way we must decide before we go further answered Gandalf then let us weigh the matter in our minds while the others rest and sleep said Aragon in the late afternoon while the others were finishing their breakfast Gandalf and Aragon went aside together and stood looking at karthas its sides were now dark and Sullen and

          
          13:55:38
          its head was in gray cloud throa watched them wondering which way the debate would go when they returned to the company Gandalf spoke and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass he was relieved he could not guess what was the other dark and secret way but the very mention of it had seemed to fill Aragon with dismay and Frodo was glad that it had been a abandoned from signs that we've seen lately said Gandalf I fear that the red horn gate may be watched and also I have

          
          13:56:14
          doubts of the weather that is coming up behind snow may come we must go with all the speed that we can even so it'll take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the pass dark will come early this evening we must leave as soon as you can get ready I will add a word of advice if I may said bmir I was born under the shadow of the White Mountains I know something of Journeys in the high places we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we come down on the other side it won't help us to keep so secret that

          
          13:56:50
          we're frozen to death when we leave here where there are still a few trees and bushes each of us should carry a of wood as large as he can bear and Bill could take a bit more couldn't you lad said Sam the pony looked at him mournfully very well said Gandalf but we must not use the wood not unless it's a choice between fire and death the company set out again with good speed at first but soon their way became Steep and difficult the twisting and climbing Road had in many places almost disappeared and was blocked with

          
          13:57:30
          many Fallen Stones the night grew deadly dark under great clouds a bitter wind swirled among the rocks by midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains The Narrow Path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left above which the Grim flanks of kathas towered up invisible in the Gloom on the right was a gulf of Darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top thodo felt a soft touch on his face he

          
          13:58:06
          put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve they went on but before long the snow was falling fast filling all the air and swirling into Frodo's eyes the dark bent shapes of gandal and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen I don't like this at all panted Sam just behind Snow's all right on a fine morning but I like to be in bed while it's falling I wish this lot would go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it there except on the high Ms of the north

          
          13:58:43
          faring a heavy fall was rare in the sh and was regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun no living Hobbit save Bilbo could remember the fell winter of 13311 when the white wolves invaded the Sha over the Frozen Brandy Wine gandal Haled snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was already ankled deep about his boots that is what I feared he said what do you say now Aragon that I feared it too Aragon answered but less than other things I knew the risk of snow though it seldom Falls heavily so far south save high up

          
          13:59:26
          in the mountains but we are not high yet we're still far down where the paths are usually open all the winter I wonder if this is a contrivance of the enemy said bmir they say in my land that he can govern the storms in the mountains of shadow that stand upon the borders of Mordor he has strange powers and many allies his arm has grown long indeed said gimy if he can draw snow down from the north to trouble us here 300 leagues away his arm has grown long said Gandalf while they were halted the wind died

          
          14:00:07
          down and the snow slackened until it almost ceased they tramped on again but they had not gone more than a furong when the storm returned with fresh Fury the wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard soon even Boromir found it hard to keep going the hobbits bent nearly double toiled along behind the taller folk but it was plain that they could not go much further if the snow continued Frodo's feet felt like liad Pippen was dragging behind even gimy as Stout as any dwarf could be was

          
          14:00:44
          grumbling as he trudged the company halted suddenly as if they had come to an agreement without any words being spoken they heard eering noises in the darkness around them it may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall but the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter Stones began to fall from the mountain side whistling over their heads or crashing on the path beside them every now and again they heard a dull Rumble as a great Boulder rolled down from hidden

          
          14:01:17
          Heights above we cannot go further tonight said barir let those call it the wind who will there are fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at us I do call it the wind said Aragon but that doesn't make what you say untrue there are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs and yet are not in League with Sauron but have purposes of their own some have been in this world longer than he Karas was called the cruel and had an ill name said gimy long years ago when

          
          14:01:56
          rumor of sain had not been heard in these lands it matters little who is the enemy if we cannot beat up off his attack said Gandalf but what can we do cried Pippin miserably he was leaning on Med and Frodo and he was shivering either stop where we are or go back said Gandalf it's no good going on only a little higher if I remember rightly this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough with the bottom of a long hard slope we should have no shelter there from snow or stones or anything

          
          14:02:32
          else and it's no good going back while the storm holds said Aragon we've passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliff wall we're under now shelter muttered Sam if this is shelter then one wall and no roof make a house the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could it faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out a little so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the Northerly wind and from the falling stones but edding blasts swirled around

          
          14:03:10
          them from every side and the snow flowed down in even denser clouds they huddled together with their backs to the wall Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits and screened them a little but before long the drifting snow was above his Haws and it went on mounting if they had had no larger companions the robit would soon have been entirely buried a great sleepiness came over Frodo he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream he thought a fire was heating his toes and

          
          14:03:47
          Out of the Shadows on the other side of the Hearth he heard Bilbo's voice speaking I don't think much of your diary he said snow storms on January the 12th there was no need to come back to report that but I wanted rest and sleep Bilbo Frodo answered with an effort when he felt himself shaken and he came back painfully to wakefulness bmir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow this will be the death of the halflings Gandalf said B it's useless to sit here until the snow goes over our

          
          14:04:23
          heads we must do something to save ourselves give them this said Gandalf searching his peack and drawing out a leathern flask just a mouthful each for all all of us it's very precious it is movor The Cordial of imladris elron gave it to me at our parting pass it round as soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs the others also revived and found fresh hope and vigor but the snow did not relent it was hled about them thicker than ever

          
          14:05:06
          and the wind blew louder what do you say to fire asked Boromir suddenly the choice seems near now between fire and death Gandalf doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us but that will not help us you may make a far if you can answered Gandalf if there are any Watchers that can endure this storm then they can see us far or no but though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir it passed the skill of Elf or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the

          
          14:05:43
          swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel at last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand picking up a he held it a loft for a moment and then with a word of command now Men He thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it at once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out and the wood flared and spotted if there are any to see then I at least am revealed to them he said I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from rivendel to the mouths of andwin but the company cared no longer

          
          14:06:23
          for watches or unfriendly eyes their hearts were ajic to see the light of the fire the wood burned meily and though all round it the snow hissed and pools of slush crept under their feet they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze there they stood stooping in a circle around the little dancing and blowing Flames a red light was on their tired and anxious faces behind them the night was like a black wall but the wood was burning fast and the snow still fell the fire burned low and the last was thrown

          
          14:07:02
          on the night is getting old said Aragon the dawn is not far off if any Dawn can Pierce these clouds said gimly Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the Blackness the snow is growing less he said and the wind is quieter Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying far but for a long time he could see no sign of their SL in then suddenly as sleep was beginning to creep over him again he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen

          
          14:07:42
          and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer very slowly a dim light began to grow at last the snow stopped all together as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded World below their Refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trotten was altogether lost but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with a threat of snow gimy looked up and shook his head kathas has not forgiven us he said he has more snow yet to fling at us if

          
          14:08:18
          we go on the sooner we go back and down the better to this all agreed but their retreat was now difficult it might well prove impossible only a few Paces From the Ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heads of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind to Great drifts against the cliff if Gandalf could go before us with a bright flame he might melt a path for you said Legolas The Storm had troubled him little and he alone of the company remained still light of

          
          14:08:54
          heart if elves could fly over mountains they might fetch the sun to save us answered Gandalf but I must have something to work on I cannot burn snow well said bmir when heads are at a loss bodies must serve as we say in my country the strongest of us must seek away see the all is now snow clad our path as we came up turned about that shoulder of rock Down Yonder it was there that the snow first began to burden us if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier Beyond it is no more than a furong off I guess

          
          14:09:34
          then let us force a path thither you and I said Aragorn Aragorn was the tallest of the company but Boromir little less in height was broader and heavier in build he led the way and Aragon followed him slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily in places the snow was breast high and often bomir seemed to be swimming or bwing with his great arms rather than walking Legolas watch watch them for a while with a smile upon his lips and then he turned to the others the strongest must seek away say

          
          14:10:11
          you but I say let a Plowman plow but choose an otter for swimming and for running light over grass and leaf or over snow an elf with that he sprang forth nimbly and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time though he had long known it that the elf had no boots but wore only light shes as he always did and his feet made little imprint in the snow farewell he said to Gandalf I go to find the sun then Swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking the toiling men with a wave

          
          14:10:46
          of his hand he passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn the others waited huddled together watching until Boromir and Aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness at length they too passed from sight the time dragged on the clouds lowered and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer and then at last they saw legalis coming back at the same time Boromir and Aragorn reappeared Round the Bend far behind him and came laboring up the

          
          14:11:23
          slope well cried liolas as he ran up I've not brought the sun she's walking in the blue fields of the South and a little wreath of snow on this red horn hillock troubles her not at all but I brought back a gleam of Good Hope for those who are doomed to go on feet there is the greatest Wind Drift of all just beyond the turn and there our strong men are almost buried they despaired until I returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall and on the other side the snow suddenly grows less

          
          14:11:57
          while further down it is no more than a white covet to cool a Hobbit's toes ah it's as I said growled gimy it was no ordinary storm it's the ill will of kathas he does not love elves and dwarves and that drift was laid to carav our Escape but happily your kathas has forgotten that you have men with you said Boromir who came up at that moment and Dy men too if I may say it though lesser men with Spades might have served you better still we have thrust a lane through the drift and but that all here

          
          14:12:34
          may be grateful who cannot run as light as elves but how are we to get down there even if you have cut through the drift said Pippen voicing the thought of all the hobbits have hope said bmir I am weary but I still have some strength left and Aragorn too we will bear the little folk the others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us come Master perigrine I'll begin with you he lifted up The Hobbit cling to my back I shall need my arms he said and stroe forward Aragorn with Mary came behind Pippin

          
          14:13:12
          marveled at his strength seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than his great limbs even now burdened as he was he was widening the track of those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went they came at length to the great drift it was flung across the mountain path like a shear and sudden wall and its Crest sharp as if shaped with knives reared up more than twice the height of Boromir but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising and falling like a bridge on the far side Mary and Pippen

          
          14:13:47
          were set down and there they waited with legol for the rest of the company to arrive after a while Boromir returned carrying Sam behind in the narrow but now well trodden track came Gandalf leading bill with gimly perched among the back baggage last came Aragorn carrying Frodo they passed through the lane but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep Rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow the spray of it half blinded the company as they crouched against the cliff and when the air

          
          14:14:21
          cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind them enough enough cried gimy we departing as quickly as we may and indeed with that last stroke the malice of the m M seemed to be expended as if kathas was satisfied that the Invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to return the threat of snow lifted the clouds began to break and the light grew broader as legus had reported they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went down so that even the hobbits could trudge along soon they

          
          14:14:57
          all stood once more on the flat Shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before the morning was now far Advanced from the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the Dell from which they had started to climb the pass Frodo's legs achd he was chilled to the Bone and hungry and his head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful March downhill black specks swam

          
          14:15:30
          before his eyes he rubbed them but the black specks remained in the distance below him but still high above the lower Foothills dark dots were circling in the air the birds again said Aragon pointing down that cannot be helped now said Gandalf whether they are good or evil or have nothing to do with us at all we must go down at once not even on the knees of kathas will we wait for another Nightfall a cold wind flowed down behind them as they turned their backs on the red horn gate and stumbled wearily down

          
          14:16:08
          the slope karthas had defeated them chapter 4 a journey in the dark it was evening and the gray light was again waning fast when they halted for the night they were very weary the mountains were veiled in deepening Dusk and the wind was cold Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the mirar of rivendel when they had eaten some food he called a counsel we cannot of course go on again tonight he said the attack on the red horn gate has tied us out and we must rest here for a while and then where are

          
          14:16:54
          we to go asked Frodo we still have our journey and our erand before us answered Gandalf we have no choice but to go on or to return to rivendel Pippin's face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to rivendel Mary and Sam looked away hopefully but Aragorn and bomir made no sign Frodo looked troubled I wish I was back there he said but how can I return without shame unless there is indeed no other way and we are already defeated you are right Frodo said Gandalf to go back is to admit defeat

          
          14:17:34
          and face worse defeat to come if we go back now then the ring must remain there we shall not be able to set out again then sooner or later rivendel will be besieged and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed the ring rails are deadly enemies but they are only Shadows yet of the power and Terror they would possess if the ruling ring was on their Master's Hand again then we must go on if there's a way said Frodo with a sigh Sam sank back into Gloom there is a way that we may attempt said Gandalf I thought from the

          
          14:18:14
          beginning when I first considered this journey that we should try it but it is not a pleasant way and I've not spoken of it to the company before Aragon was against it until the Passover the mountains had at least been tried if it's a worse road than the red horn gate then it must be evil in indeed said Mary but you'd better tell us all about it and let us know the worst at once the road that I speak of leads to the minds of Moria said Gandalf only gimly lifted up his head a smoldering fire was in his eyes on all the others a

          
          14:18:51
          dread fell At The Mention Of that name even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague fear the road may lead to Moria but how can we hope that it will lead through Mor said Aragorn Darkly it is a name of ilen said bmir nor do I see the need to go there if we cannot cross the mountains Let Us Journey southwards until we come to the Gap of Rohan where men are friendly to my people taking the road that I followed on my way hither or we might pass by and cross the ice and into langstrand and leenon and so come to

          
          14:19:28
          Gondor from the regions night to the sea things have changed since you came North bmir answered Gandalf did you not hear what I told you of San with him I may have business of my own there all is over but the ring must not come near Eisen guard if that can be by any means prevented the gap of Rowan is closed to us while we go with the bearer as for the longer road we cannot afford the time we might spend a year in such a journey and we should pass through many lands that are EMP and haress yet they would not be safe the

          
          14:20:07
          watchful eyes of both Saran and of the enemy are on them when you came North Boromir you were in the enemy's eyes only one stray Wanderer from the south and a matter of small concern to him his mind was busy with the pursuit of the ring but you return now as a member of the Ring's company and you are in Peril as long as you remain with us the danger will increase with every League that we go South under the naked Sky since our open attempt on the mountain pass our plight has become more desperate I fear I see now little hope

          
          14:20:43
          if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while and cover our Trail therefore I advise that we should go neither over the mountains nor round them but under them there is a road at any rate that the enemy will least expect us to take we do not know what he expects said B he may watch all roads likely and unlikely in that case to enter Moria would be to walk into a trap hardly better than knocking at the gates of The Dark Tower itself the name of Moria is black you speak of what you do not know when you liken Moria to the stronghold

          
          14:21:23
          of saurin answered Gandalf I alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the dark lord and only in his older and lesser dwelling in do gor those who pass the gates of bador do not return but I would not lead you into moror if there were no hope of coming out again if there are Orcs there it may prove ill for us that is true but most of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five Armies the Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar but there is a hope that Moria is still

          
          14:22:01
          free there is even a chance that dwarves are there and that in some deep Hall of his father's barlin son of fundin may be found however it may prove one must tread the path that need chooses I will tread the path with you Gandalf said gimy I will go and look on the halls of durin whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that are shocked good gibl said Gandalf you and enourage me we will seek the hidden doors together and we will come through in the ruins of the dwarves a dwarf's head will be less easy to bewilder than

          
          14:22:43
          elves or men or Hobbits yet it will not be the first time that I have been to moror I sought there long for thin son of th after he was lost I passed through and I came out again alive I too once passed the dimal gate said Aragon quietly but though I also came out again the memory is very evil I don't wish to enter Moria a second time and I don't wish to enter it even once said Pippin nor me muttered Sam of course not said Gandalf who would but the question is who will follow me if I lead you there I will said gimy

          
          14:23:27
          eagerly I will said Aragorn heavily you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow and have said no word of blame I will follow your lead now if this last warning does not move you it's not of the Ring nor of us others that I'm thinking now but of you gandal and I say to you if you pass the doors of Moria beware I will not go said Boromir not unless the vote of the whole company is against me what do legus and the little folk say the ring bearer's voice surely should be heard I do not wish to go to moror said

          
          14:24:10
          Legolas The Hobbit said nothing Sam looked at Frodo at last Frodo spoke I do not wish to go he said but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf I beg that there should be no vote until we've slept on it gandal will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold Gloom how the wind howls at these words all fell into silent thought they heard the wind hissing among the rocks and trees and there was a howling and wailing around them in the empty spaces of the night suddenly Aragorn leaped to his

          
          14:24:50
          feet how the wind howls he cried it is howling with wolf voices the Ws have come West of the mountains need we wait until morning then said Gandalf it's as I said the Hunt is up even if we live to see the dawn who now will wish to Journey South by night with the wild wolves on his Trail how far is Moria asked Boromir there was a door Southwest of kathas some 15 miles as the crow flies and maybe 20 as the wolf runs answered gandal grimly then let us start as soon as it's light tomorrow if we can said

          
          14:25:31
          Boromir the wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears true said Aragon loosening his sword in his cheath but where the W howls there also the orc prows I wish I'd taken elon's advice mutter Pippin to Sam I'm no good after all there's not enough of the breed of bobas the bull roarer in me these HS freeze my blood I don't ever remember feeling so wretched my heart's right down in my toes Mr Pippen said Sam but we aren't eting yet and there are some Stout folk here with us whatever may be in store

          
          14:26:12
          for old Gandalf I'll wager it isn't a wolf's belly for their defense in the night the company climbed to the top of the small hill under which they had been Sheltering it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted trees about which lay a broken circle of Boulder stones in the midst of this they lit a fire for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep their trail from Discovery by the hunting pecs round the fire they sat and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily poor Bill the pony trembled and

          
          14:26:48
          sweated where he stood the howling of the Wolves was now all round them sometimes nearer and sometimes further off in the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering over the brow of the Hill some had Advanced almost to the Ring of stones at a gap in the circle a great Dark Wolf shape could be seen halted gazing at them a shuddering howl broke from him as if he were a captain summoning his pack to the assault Gandalf stood up and stroe forward holding his staff Aloft listen Hound of saen he cried Gandalf is here

          
          14:27:28
          fly if you value your foul skin I will sh ril you from tail to snout if you come within this ring the wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap at that moment there was a sharp twang Legolas had loosed his bow there was a hideous yell and the leaping shape thudded to the ground the Elish Arrow had pierced its throat the watching eyes were suddenly extinguished gandal and Aragorn stroe forward but the hill was deserted the hunting packs had fled all about them the darkness grew silent and

          
          14:28:07
          No Cry came on the sighing [Music] wind the night was old and Westward the waning moon was setting gleaming fitfully through the breaking clouds suddenly Frodo started from sleep without warning a storm of hows broke out Fierce and wild all about the camp a great host of Wars had gathered silently and was now attacking them from every side at once fling fuel on the fire cried Gandalf to the hobbits draw your blades and stand back to back in the leaping light as the fresh wood blazed up Frodo saw many gray shapes spring over the

          
          14:28:47
          Ring of stones more and more followed through the throat of one huge leader Aragon passed his sword with a Thrust with a great sweep Boromir heed the head off another beside them gimly stood with his Stout legs apart wielding his dwarf ax in the wavering fir light Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow he rose up a great menacing shape like the Monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and stroe to meet the Wolves they gave back before him high in

          
          14:29:23
          the air he tossed the Blazing brand it flared with a sudden white Radiance like lightning and his voice rolled like thunder he cried there was a Roar and a crackle and the tree above him burst into a leaf and Bloom of blinding Flame the fire leapt from Treetop to Treetop the whole hill was crowned with dazzling light the swords and knives of the Defenders sha and flickered the last Arrow of Legolas kindled in the air as it flew and plunged burning Into the Heart of a Great Wolf Chieftain all the others fled

          
          14:30:07
          slowly the fire died till nothing was left but Falling Ash and Sparks a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree stumps and blew Darkly from the hill as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky their enemies were routed and did not return what did I tell you Mr Pippen said Sam sheathing his sword wolves won't get in him that was an eye opener and no mistake nearly singed the hair off my head when the full light of the morning came no signs of the Wolves were to be found and they looked in vain for the

          
          14:30:46
          bodies of the Dead no trace of the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on the hilltop all were undamaged save one of which only the point was left it is as I feared said Gandalf they were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness let us eat quickly and go that day the weather changed again almost as if it was at the command of some power that had no longer any use for snow since they had retreated from the pass a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved

          
          14:31:23
          in the wild could be seen from far away the wind had been turning through North to Northwest during the night and now it failed the clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened high and blue as they stood upon the hillside ready to depart a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountaintops we must reach the doors Before Sunset said Gandalf or I fear we shall not reach them at all it's not far but our path may be winding for here Aragon cannot guide us he has seldom walked in this country and only once

          
          14:32:00
          have I been under the West wall of Moria and that was long ago there it lies he said pointing away southeastwards to where the mountains sides fell sheer into the shadows of their feet in the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare Cliffs and in their midst taller than the rest one great gray wall when we left the pass I led you southwards and not back to our starting point as some of you may have noticed it's well that I did so for now we have several miles less to cross and haste is needed let us

          
          14:32:38
          go I do not know which to Hope said Boromir grimly that gandal will find what he seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost forever all choices seem ill and to be caught between Wolves and the wall the likeliest chance lead on gimy now walked ahead by the Wizard's side so eager was he to come to Moria together they led the company back towards the mountains the only Road of old to Moria from the West had Lin along the course of a stream the sanon that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near

          
          14:33:17
          where the doors had stood but either Gandalf was astray or else the land had changed in recent years for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it only a few miles southwards from their start the the morning was passing towards noon and still the company wandered and scrambled in a Barren country of red stones nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it all was Bleak and dry the heart sank they saw no living thing and not a bird was in the sky but what the night

          
          14:33:53
          would bring if it caught them in that lost land none of them cared to think suddenly gimy who had pressed on ahead called back to them he was standing on a null and pointing to the right hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel it was empty and silent and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and red stained stones of its bed but on the near side there was a path much broken and decayed that wound its way among the ruined walls and paving stones of an ancient High Road ah here it is at last

          
          14:34:32
          said Gandalf this is where the stream ran sanon the gate stream they used to call it but what has happened to the water I cannot guess it used to be Swift and noisy come we must hurry on we are late the company were foot sore and tired but they trudged doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles the sun turned from the noon and began to go west after a brief Halt and a hasty meal the they went on again before them the mountains frowned but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the higher

          
          14:35:10
          shoulders and the far Eastward Peaks at length they came to a sharp Bend there the road which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left turned and went due east again rounding the corner they saw before them a low Cliff some five fathoms High with a broken and Jagged top over it a trickling water dripped through a wide Cliff that seemed to have been carved out by a f that had once been strong and full indeed things have changed said Gandalf but there's no mistaking the

          
          14:35:50
          place there is all the remains of the stair Falls if I remember right there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side but the main road wound a way left and climbed with several Loops up to the level ground at the top there used to be a shallow Valley beyond the falls right up to the walls of Moria and the sanon flowed through it with the road beside it let us go and see what things are like now they found the stone steps without difficulty and gimy sprang swiftly up them followed by gandal and Frodo when

          
          14:36:28
          they reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way and the reason for the drying up of the gate stream was revealed behind them the sinking Sun filled the cool Western Sky with glimmering gold before them stretched a dark still Lake neither sky nor Sunset was reflected on its suen surface the sanon had been damned and had filled all the valley beyond the ominous water were Reed vast Cliffs their Stern faces PID in the fading light final and impossible no sign of gate or entrance nor a Fisher

          
          14:37:06
          or crack could Frodo see in the frowning wall there are the walls of Moria said Gandalf pointing across the water and there the gates stood Once Upon a Time the Elven door at the end of the road from Holland by which we've come but this way is blocked none of the company I guess will wish to swim this Gloomy water at the end of the day it has an UNH wholesome look we must find a way around the northern Edge said gimy the first thing for the company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us

          
          14:37:45
          even if there were no Lake we could not get our baggage Pony up this stair but in any case we cannot take the poor Beast into the mines said Gandalf the road under the mountains is a dark Road and there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can poor old Bill said Frodo I hadn't thought of that and poor Sam I wonder what he'll say I'm sorry said Gandalf poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes to my heart to turn him a drift now I would have traveled lighter and brought no

          
          14:38:24
          animal least of all this one that Sam is fond of if I had had my way I feared all along that we should be a iged to take this road the day was drawing to its end and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset when the company with all the speed they could climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake in breadth it looked to been no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point how far it stretched away Southward they could not see in the failing light but its northern end was

          
          14:38:59
          no more than half a mile from where they stood and between the Stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a rim of open ground they hurried forward where they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far Shore that Gandalf was making for and then he had still to find the doors when they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow Creek that barred their way it was green and stagnant Thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclosing Hills

          
          14:39:32
          gimly stroe forward undeterred and found that the water was shallow no more than ankle deep at the edge behind him they walked in file threading their way with care for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones and footing was treacherous Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet as Sam the last of the company LED Bill up onto the dry ground on the far side there came a soft sound a swish followed by a plop as if a fish had Disturbed The Still surface of the

          
          14:40:12
          water turning quickly they saw ripples black edged with shadow in the waning light great Rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake there was a bubbling noise and then silence the Dusk deepened and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in Cloud Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace and the others followed as quickly as they could they reached the strip of land between the lake and the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen yards across and unencumbered with Fallen rocks and stones but they found a way

          
          14:40:52
          hugging the cliff and keeping as far from the Dark Water as they might a mile southwards along the shore They Came Upon Holly trees stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows The Remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned Valley but close under the cliff there Stood Still strong and living two tall trees larger than any trees of Holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined their great Roots spread from the wall to the water under the looming

          
          14:41:27
          Cliffs they had looked like mere bushes when seen far off from the top of the stair but now they towered overhead stiff dark and Silent throwing deep night Shadows about their feet standing like Sentinel pillars at the end of the road well here we are at last said Gandalf here the Elven way from Hollen ended Holly was the token of the people of that land and they planted it here to Mark the end of their domain for the west door was made chiefly for their use and their traffic with the Lords of Moria those were happier days when there

          
          14:42:06
          was still close friendship at times between folk of different race even between dwarves and elves it was not the fault of the dwarves that the Friendship waned said gimly I have not heard that it was the fault of the elves said legalis I have heard both said gandal and I will not give judgment now but I beg you two Legolas and gimy at least to befriend and to help me I need you both the doors are shut and hidden and the sooner we find them the better night is at hand turning to the others he said

          
          14:42:42
          while I'm searching will you each make ready to enter the mines for here I fear we must say farewell to our good Beast of Burden you must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter weather you will not need it inside nor I hope when we come through and journey on down into the South instead each of us must take a share of what the pony carried especially the food and the water skins but you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken Place Mr Gandalf cried Sam angry and distressed I won't

          
          14:43:18
          have it and that's flat after he's come so far and all I'm sorry Sam said the wizard but when the doors open I don't think you'll be able to drag your bill inside into the long dark a moror you'll have to choose between Bill and your master he'd follow Mr Frodo into a Dragon's Den if I led him protested Sam it' be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these wolves about it will be short of murder I hope said Gandalf he laid his hand on the pony's head and spoke in a low voice go with words of guard and guiding on you

          
          14:43:58
          he said you a wise beast and have learned much in rivendel make your ways to places where you can find grass and so come in time to elon's House or wherever you wish to go there Sam he'll have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as we have Sam stood Solly by the pony and returned no answer Bill seeming to understand well what was going on nuzzled up to him putting his nose to Sam's ear Sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlading all the pony pecks and throwing them on the

          
          14:44:37
          ground the other sorted out the goods making a pile of all that could be left behind and dividing up the rest when this was done they turned to watch Gandalf he appeared to have done nothing he was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes gimy was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with his axe Legolas was pressed against The Rock as if listening well here we are and already said Mary but where are the doors I

          
          14:45:13
          can't see any sign of them North doors are not made to be seen when shut said gimy they are invisible and their own masters cannot find them or open them if their secret is forgotten but this door was not made to be a secret known only to dwarves said said gandal coming suddenly to life and turning round unless things are all together changed eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs he walked forward to the wall right between the shadow of the trees there was a smoth space and over this he

          
          14:45:49
          passed his hands to and fro muttering words under his breath then he stepped back look he said can you see anything now the moon now Shone upon the Great face of the rock but they could see nothing else for a while then slowly on the surface where the Wizard's hands had pass faint lines appeared like Slender veins of silver running in the stone at first they were no more than pale gossam of threads so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon caught them but steadily they grew broader and

          
          14:46:25
          clearer until their design could be guessed at the top as high as Gand could reach was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elish character below though the threads were in places blurred or broken the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with Seven Stars beneath these again were two trees each bearing Crescent moons more clearly than all else they Shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with many Rays there are the emblems of durin cried gim and there is the tree of the

          
          14:47:06
          High Elves said Legolas and the star of the House of fanor said Gandalf they are rought of eildon that mirrors only Starlight and Moonlight and sleeps until it is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle Earth it is long since I heard them and I thought deeply before I could recall them to my mind what does the writing say asked Frodo who was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch I thought I knew the elf letters but I can't read these the words are in the Elven tongue

          
          14:47:44
          of the west of Middle Earth in the Elder days answered Gandalf but they do not say anything of importance to us they say only the doors of durin Lord of Moria speak friend and enter and underneath small and faint is written I Nar made them Kell bmore of Holland Drew these signs what does it mean by speak friend and enter asked Mary that is plain enough said gimy if you are a friend speak the password and the doors will open and you can enter yes said Gandalf these doors are probably governed by

          
          14:48:27
          words some dwarf Gates will open only at special time or for particular persons and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are known these doors have no key in the days of durin they were not secret they usually stood open and door Wards set here but if they were shut any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in at least so it is recorded is it not gimy it is said the dwarf but what the word was is not remembered naari and his craft and all his Kindred have vanished

          
          14:49:07
          from the Earth but do not you know the word Gandalf asked Boromir in Surprise no said the wizard The Others looked dismayed only Aragon who knew Gandalf well remained silent and unmoved then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot cried bmir glancing back with a shudder at the Dark Water you told us that you had pass through the mines how could that be if you did not know how to enter the answer to your first question Boromir said the wizard is that I do not know the word yet but we shall soon see

          
          14:49:47
          and he added with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows you may ask what is the use of my Deeds when they have proved useless as for your other question do you doubt my tale or have you no wits left I did not enter this way I came from the East if you wish to know I will tell you that these doors open outwards from the inside you may thrust them open with your hands from the outside nothing will move them save the spell of command they cannot be forced inwards what are you going to do then

          
          14:50:23
          asked Pippin undaunted by the Wizard's bristling brows knock on the doors with your head pedig toque said Gandalf but if that does not shatter them and I am allowed a little piece from foolish questions I will seek for the opening words I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves or men or Orcs that was ever used for such a purpose I can still remember t score of them without searching in my mind but only a few trials I think will be needed and I shall not have to call on gim lier words

          
          14:50:59
          of the secret dwarf tongue that they teach To None the opening words were Elish like the writing on the arch that seems certain he stepped up to the Rock again and lightly touched with his staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the Anvil men he said in a commanding voice the silver lines faded but the blank Gray they Stone did not stir many times he repeated these words in different order or varied them then he tried other spells one after another speaking now faster and louder now soft

          
          14:51:43
          and slow then he spoke many single words of Elvis speech nothing happened the cliff towered into the night the countless stars were kindled the wind blew cold and the doors stood fast again Gandalf approached the wall and lift in up his arms he spoke in tones of command and Rising wroth edro edro he cried and struck the rock with his staff open open he shouted and followed it with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of Middle Earth then he threw his staff on the ground

          
          14:52:21
          and sat down in silence at that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the howling of wolv Bill the pony started in fear and Sam sprang to his side and whispered softly to him do not let him run away said bmir it seems that we shall need him still if the wolves do not find us how I hate this foul pool he stooped and picking up a large Stone he cast it far into the dark water the stone vanished with a soft slap but at the same instant there was a Swish and a bubble great Rippling

          
          14:53:01
          Rings formed on the surface out Beyond where the stone had fallen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff why did you do that bmir said Frodo I hate this place too and I'm afraid I don't know of what not of wolves or the dark behind the doors but of something else I'm afraid of the pool don't disturb it I wish we could get away said Mary why doesn't Gandalf do something quick said Pippen Gandalf took no notice of them he sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious thought the

          
          14:53:40
          mournful howling of the Wolves Was Heard again the ripples on the water grew and came closer some were already lepping on the shore with a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet he was laughing I have it he cried of course of course absurdly simple like most riddles when you see the answer picking up his staff he stood before the Rock and said in a clear voice melon the star Shone out briefly and Faded again then silently a great doorway was outlined though not a crack or joint had been visible before slowly

          
          14:54:20
          it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch until both doors lay back against the wall through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steep deeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night the company stared in wonder I was wrong after all said Gandalf and gimy too Mary of all people was on the right track the opening word was inscribed on the archway all the time the translation should have been say friend and enter I had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors

          
          14:55:00
          opened quite simple too simple for a learned LW master in these suspicious days those were happier times now let us go he stroe forward and set his foot on the lowest step but at that moment several things happened Frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry Bill the pony gave a wild nay of fear and turned tail and dashed away Along The Lakeside into the darkness Sam leapt after him and then hearing Frodo's cry he ran back again weeping and cursing the others swung around and saw the Waters of the lake

          
          14:55:39
          seething as if a host of snakes were swimming up from the southern end out from the water a long senous tentacle had crawled it was pale green and luminous and wet its fingered end had hold of Frodo's foot and was dragging him into the water Sam on his knees was now slashing ing at it with a knife the arm let go of Frodo and Sam pulled him away crying out for help 20 other arms came Rippling out the dark water boiled and there was a hideous stench into the gateway up the stairs quick shouted Gandalf leaping back

          
          14:56:21
          rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to the ground where they stood he drove them forward they were just in time time Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up and Gandalf had just began to climb when the groping tentacles red across the narrow Shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors one came wriggling over the threshold glistening in the Starlight Gandalf turned and paused if he was considering what word would close the gate again from within there was no need

          
          14:56:57
          many coiling arms seized the doors on either side and with a horrible strength swung them round with a shattering Echo they slammed and all light was lost a noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous Stone Sam clinging to Frodo's arm collapsed on a step in the black darkness poor old Bill he said in a choking voice poor old Bill wolves and snakes but the snakes were too much for him I I had to choose Mr Frodo I had to come with you they heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the

          
          14:57:39
          doors there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled but the doors did not open well well said the wizard The Passage is blocked behind us now and there is only one way out on the other side of the mountains I fear from the sounds that Boulders have been piled up and and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate I'm sorry for the trees were beautiful and had stood so long I felt something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water said Frodo what was the thing or were there many of them I

          
          14:58:20
          don't know answered Gandalf but the arms were all Guided by one purpose something has crept or has been driven out of dark Waters Under the Mountain there are older and Fowler things than Orcs in the Deep places of the world he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized on Frodo first among all the company Boromir muttered under his breath but the echoing Stone magnified the sound to a horse whisper that all could hear in the Deep places of the world and thither we are going against

          
          14:58:58
          my wish who will lead us now in this deadly dark I will said Gandalf and gimy shall walk with me follow my staff as the wizard passed on ahead and up the great steps he held his staff aoft and from its tip there came a faint Radiance the wide stairway was sound and undamaged 200 steps they counted Broad and shallow and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into the dark let us sit and rest and have something to eat here on the landing since we can't find a dining room said

          
          14:59:38
          Frodo he had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm and suddenly he felt extremely hungry The Proposal was welcomed by all and they sat down on the upper steps dim figures in the Gloom after they had eaten gandal gave them each a third sip of the Miro of rivendel it will not last much longer I'm afraid he said but I think we need it after that horror at the gate and unless we have great luck we shall need all that is left before we see the other side go carefully with the water too there are

          
          15:00:16
          many streams and wells in the mines but they should not be touched we may not have a chance of filling our skins and Bottles till we come down into diil Dale how long is that going to take us asked Frodo I cannot say answered Gandalf it depends on many chances but going straight without map or losing our way we shall take three or four marches I expect it cannot be less than 40 miles from West door to Eastgate in a direct line and the road May wind much after only a brief rest they started on their way again all were

          
          15:00:56
          eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible and were willing tired as they were to go on marching still for several hours Gandalf walked in front as before in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff the light of which just showed the ground before his feet in his right he held his sword glaming behind him came gimy his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side behind the dwarf walked Frodo and he had drawn the short sword sting no gleam came from the blades of

          
          15:01:34
          sting or of glaming and that was some comfort for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder days these swords Shone with a cold light if any orc were near at hand behind Frodo went Sam and after him Legolas and the young Hobbits and Boromir in the dark of the rear grim and Silent walked Aragorn the passage Twisted round a few turns and then began to descend it went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again the air grew hot and stifling but it was not foul and at times they felt currents of cooler air

          
          15:02:16
          upon their faces issuing from half guest openings in the walls there were many of these in the pale Ray of the wizard staff Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and archers and of other passages and tunnels sloping up or running steeply down or opening blankly dark on either side it was bewildering Beyond hope of remembering gimle aided Gandalf very little except by his Stout courage at least he was not as were most of the others troubled by the mere darkness in itself often the wizard consulted him at

          
          15:02:56
          points where the choice of way was doubtful but it was always gandal who had the final word the minds of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of gimy gloin son dwarf of the mountain race though he was to Gandalf the far off memories of a journey long before were now of little help but even in the Gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whether he wished to go and he did not fter as long as there was a path that led towards his goal Don't Be Afraid said Aragon there was a

          
          15:03:34
          pause longer than usual and Gandalf and gimy were Whispering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously don't be afraid I've been with him on many a journey if never on one so dark and there are Tales of rivendel of Greater Deeds of his than any that I have seen he will not go astray if there is any path to find he has let us inhere against our fears but he'll lead us out again at whatever cost to himself he's sure of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen buuel it was well for the company that

          
          15:04:16
          they had such a guide they had no fuel nor any means of making torches in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind but without any light they would soon have come to grief there were not only many roads to choose from there were also in many places holes and pitfalls and dark Wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed there were fishes and chasms and the walls and floors and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet the widest was more than 7 ft

          
          15:04:50
          across and it was long before Pippen could summon enough courage to leap over the Dreadful Gap the noise of churning water came up from Far Below as if some great Mill wheel was turning in the depths rope muttered Sam I knew I'd want it if I hadn't got it as these dangers became more frequent their March became slower already they seemed to have been tramping on on endlessly to the mountains Roots they were more than weary and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere th those Spirits had

          
          15:05:31
          risen for a while after his escape and after food and a draft of the cordial but now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept over him again though he had been healed in rivendel of the knife stroke that Grim wound had not been without effect his senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen one sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions save perhaps Gandalf and he was in any case the bearer of the Ring itd hung

          
          15:06:07
          upon its chain against his breast and at whils it seemed a heavy weight he felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following but he said nothing he gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried Whispers there was no sound but the sound of their own feet the dull stamp of gim's dwarf Boots the heavy tread of bottom a the light step of Legolas the soft scarce heard patter of hobby feet and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his

          
          15:06:47
          long stride when they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all unless it were occasionally a faint Trickle and a drip of unseen water yet Frodo began to hear or to imagine that he heard something else like the faint fall of soft bare feet it was never loud enough or near enough for him to feel certain that he heard it but once it had started it never stopped while the company was moving but it was not an echo for when they halted it pattered on for a little while all by itself and then grew

          
          15:07:24
          still it was after Nightfall when they had entered the mines they'd been going for several hours with only brief halts when Gandalf came to his first serious check before him stood a wide dark Arch opening into three passages all LED in the same general direction eastwards but the left hand passage plunged down while the right hand climbed up and the middleway seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow I have no memory of this place at all said Gandalf standing uncertainly under the arch

          
          15:08:00
          he held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice but nothing of the kind was to be seen I'm too weary to decide he said shaking his head and I expect that you are all as weary as I am or weier we'd better hold here for what is left of the night you know what I mean in here it's ever dark but outside the late moon is riding Westward and the middle night has passed poor old Bill said Sam I wonder where he is I hope those wolves haven't got him yet to the left of the great Arch they

          
          15:08:41
          found a stone door it was half closed but swung back easily to a gentle thrust Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock steady steady cried Gandalf as Mery and Pippen pushed forward glad to find a place where they could rest with at least beasts more feeling of shelter than in the open passage steady you do not know what is inside yet I'll go first he went in cautiously and the others filed behind there he said pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor before his feet they saw a large round hole

          
          15:09:20
          like the mouth of a well broken and Rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit fragments of stone lay near one of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom said Aragon to Mary let the guide go first while you have one this seems to have been a guard room made for the watching of the three passages said gimy that hole was plainly a will for the God's use covered with a stone lid but the lid is broken and we must all take care in the

          
          15:09:57
          dark Pippin felt curiously attracted by the will while the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber as far as possible from the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered over a chill air seemed to strike his face rising from invisible depths moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose Stone and Let It Drop he felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound then Far Below as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place there came

          
          15:10:35
          a plunk very distant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft what's that cried Gandalf he was relieved when Pippen confessed what he had done but he was angry and Pippen could see his eyes glinting full of a toque he growled this is a serious Journey not a hobbit walking party throw yourself in next time time and then you'll be no further nuisance now be quiet nothing more Was Heard for several minutes but then there came out of the depths faint knocks to tap tapt they stopped and when The Echoes had died away they were

          
          15:11:18
          repeated tapt Tom tap tap tap Tom they sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort but after after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again that was the sound of a hammer I've never heard one said gimy yes said Gandalf and I don't like it it may have nothing to do with perrin's foolish Stone but probably something has been Disturbed that would have been better left quiet pray do nothing of the kind again let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble you Pippen can go on the first watch as a reward he

          
          15:12:02
          growled as he rolled himself in a blanket Pippen sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark but he kept on turning round fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well he wished he could cover the hole if only with a blanket but he dared not move or go near it even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep actually Gandalf was awake though lying still and Silent he was deep in thought trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the minds and considering anxiously the next course

          
          15:12:41
          that he should take a false turn now might be disastrous after an hour he rose up and came over to Pippin get into a corner and have a sleep my lad he said in a Kinder tone you want to sleep I expect I can't get a wink so I may as well do the watching I know what is the matter with me he muttered as he sat down by the door I need smoke I've not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm the last thing that Pippen saw as sleep took him was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor

          
          15:13:20
          shielding a growing chip in his niled hands between his knees the flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose and the puff of smoke it was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep he had sat and watched all alone for about 6 hours and had let the others rest and in the watches I've made up my mind he said I don't like the feel of the middle way and I don't like the smell of the left hand way there's foul air down there or I'm no guide I shall take the right hand passage it's time we begin to climb up again

          
          15:14:00
          for eight Dark Hours not counting two brief halts they marched on and they met no danger and heard nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the Wizard's light bobbing like a will of the Wisp in front of them the passage they had chos and wound steadily upwards as far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves and as it Rose it grew loftier and wider there were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side and the floor was level and sound without pits or cracks evidently they had struck what

          
          15:14:36
          once had been an important Road and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first March in this way they Advanced some 15 miles measured in a direct line East though they must have actually walked 20 mi or more as the road climbed upwards Frodo's Spirits Rose a little but he still felt oppressed and still at times he heard or thought he heard away behind the company and Beyond the fall and patter of their feet a following footstep that was not an echo they had marched as far as the

          
          15:15:13
          hobbits could endure without a rest and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished they seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space there was a great draft a warmer air behind them and before them the darkness was cold on their faces they halted and crowded together anxiously gandal seemed pleased I chose the right way he said at last we're coming to the habitable parts and I guess that we are not far now from

          
          15:15:49
          the Eastern Gate but we're high up a good deal higher than the diil gate unless I'm mistaken from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide Hall I will now risk a little real light he raised his staff and for a brief instant there was a blaze like a flash of lightning great Shadows sprang up and fled and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars he of stone before them and on either side stretched a huge empty Hall its Black Walls polished and smooth as glass

          
          15:16:28
          flashed and glittered three other entrances they saw dark black arches one straight before them eastwoods and one on either side then the light went out this is all that I shall Venture on for the present said Gandalf there used to be great windows on the mountain side and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the mines I think we've reached them now but it's night outside again and we can't tell until morning if I'm right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in but in the

          
          15:17:05
          meanwhile we'd better go no further let us rest if we can things have gone well so far and the greater part of the dark road is over but we're not yet through and it's a long way down to the gates that open on the world the company spent that night in the great cavernous Hall huddled close together in the corner to escape the Dr there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the Eastern Archway all about them as they lay hung the darkness Hollow and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness and

          
          15:17:42
          vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages the wildest imaginings that dark rumor had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time said Sam and every one of them busier than badgers for 500 years to make all this and most in hard rock too what did they do it all for they didn't live in these darksome holes surely these are not holes said gimy this is the great realm and city of the

          
          15:18:25
          delf and of old it was not darksome but but full of light and Splendor as is still Remembered in our songs he rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice while The Echoes ran away into the roof the world was young the mountains green no stain yet on the moon was seen no words were laid on stream or stone when Duran woke and walked alone he named the nameless Hills and Dells he drank from yet untasted Wells he stooped and looked in mid air and saw a crown of stars appear as gems Upon A Silver

          the Orcs have often plundered Moria there's nothing left in the upper halls and since the dwarf sled no one dares to seek the shafts and treasures down in the Deep places they're drowned in water or in the shadow of fear then what do the dwarves want to come back for asked Sam for mithil answered Gandalf the wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels the toys of the dwarves nor in Iron their servant such things they found here it is true especially iron but they did not need to Dell for them all things that they

          
          15:22:09
          desired they could obtain in traffic for here alone in the world was found Moria silver or true silver as some have called it mithil is the Elvish name the dwarves have a name which they do not tell its worth was 10 times that of gold and now it's beyond price for little is left above ground and even the Orcs dare not delve here for it the loads lead away north towards kathas and down to Darkness the dwarves tell no Tale But even as Mythril was the foundation of their wealth so also it was their

          destruction they delved too greedily and too deep and Disturbed that from which they fled durin's bane of what they they brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all and given it in tribute to Sauron who covers it Mythril all folk desired it it could be beaten like copper and Polished like glass and the dwarves could make of it a metal light and yet harder than tempered steel its beauty was like to that of common silver but the beauty of mithil did not tarnish or grow dim the elves dearly loved it and among

          many uses they made of it ethin star moon which was so upon the doors Bilbo had a corset of mithil rings that Thorin gave him I wonder what has become of it Gathering dust still in Mel delving martham house I suppose what cried gimy startled out of his silence a corselet of Moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said Gandalf I never told him but its worth was greater than the value of the whole sh and everything in it Frodo said nothing but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the rings of his

          male shirt he felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the Sha under his jacket had Bilbo known he felt no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well it was indeed a kingly gift but now his thought had been carried away from the dark mindes to rivendel to Bilbo and to bagend in the days while Bilbo was still there he wished with all his heart that he was back there and in those days mowing the lawn or pottering among the flowers and that he had never heard of Moria or mithil or the

          ring a deep silence fell One By One The Others fell asleep Thro was on guard as if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places thread came over him his hands were cold and his brow damp he listened all his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours but he heard no sound not even the imagined echo of a footfall his watch was nearly over when far off where he guessed that the Western arway stood he fancied that he could see two pale Points of Light almost like luminous eyes he started his

          
          15:25:37
          head had nodded I must have nearly fallen asleep on guard he thought I was on the edge of a dream he stood up and rubbed his eyes and remained standing peering into the dark until he was relieved by legus when he laid down he quickly went to sleep but it seemed to him that the dream went on he heard Whispers and saw the two pale Points of Light approaching slowly he woke and found that the others were speaking softly near him and that a dim light was falling on his face high up above the Eastern Archway through a

          
          15:26:12
          shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam and across the hall through the northern Arch light also glimmered faint and distantly Frodo set up good morning said Gandalf for morning it is again at last I was right you see we are high up on the east side of Moria before today is over we ought to find the great Gates and see the Waters of mirror lying in the dim real Dale before us I shall be glad said gimy I've looked on Warrior and it's very great but it has become dark and Dreadful and we have found no sign of my Kindred I doubt now

          
          15:26:53
          that barin ever came here after they had breakfasted Gand decided to go on again at once we're tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he said I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria no indeed said barir which way shall we take y Eastward Arch maybe said Gandalf but I don't know yet exactly where we are unless I'm quite astray I guess that we're above and to the north of the great Gates and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them the Eastern Arch will

          
          15:27:32
          probably prove to be the way that we must take but before we make up our minds we ought to look about us let us go towards the light in the north door if we could find a window it would help but I fear that the light comes only down deep shafts following his lead the company passed under the northern Arch they found themselves in a wide Corridor as they went along it the glimmer grew stronger and and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right it was high and flat topped and the stone door

          
          15:28:04
          was still upon its hinges standing half open beyond it was a large Square chamber it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright and they blinked as they entered their feet Disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shape they could not at first make out the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall it slanted upwards and far above a small square patch of Blue Sky could be seen the light of the

          
          15:28:43
          shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room a single oblong block about 2 ft high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone it looks like a tomb muttered Frodo and bent forwards with with a curious sense of for boing to look more closely at it Gandalf came quickly to his side on the slab runes were deeply Graven these are deon's runes such as were used of old in Moria said Gandalf here is written in the tongues of men and dwarves barlin son of fundin Lord of Moria he is dead then said Frodo I

          
          15:29:28
          feared it was so gimly cast his hood over his face chapter five the bridge of kazad Doom the company of the Rings stood silent beside the tomb of barlin Frodo thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf and of barin's visit to the Sha long ago in that Dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world at length they stirred and looked up and began to search for anything that would give them Tidings of barin's fate or show what had become of his

          
          15:30:14
          folk there was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber under the shaft by both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying and among them were broken swords and ax heads and cloven Shields and Helms some of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackened blades there were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls and in them were large Ironbound chests of wood all had been broken and plundered but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book it had been slashed

          
          15:30:52
          and stabbed and partly burned and it was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read Gandalf lifted it carefully but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slab he poured over it for some time without speaking Frodo and gim standing at his side could see as he gingerly turned the leaves that they were written by many different hands in runes both of Moria and of Dale and here and there in Elish script at last gandal looked up it seems to be a record of the

          
          15:31:33
          fortunes of barin's folk he said I guess that it began with their coming to diil Dale n on 30 years ago the pages seem to have numbers referring to the years after their arrival the top page is marked one three so at least two are missing from the beginning listen to this we drove out Walks from The Great Gate and guard I think the next word is blurred and burned probably broom we slew many in the bright I think sun in the Dale Flo was killed by an arrow he slew the great then there is a blur followed by

          
          15:32:18
          flowy undergrass near midir the next line or two I cannot read then comes we have taken the 20 first Hall of North End to dwell in there is I cannot read what a shaft is mentioned then barin has set up his seat in the chamber of mazul the Chamber of Records said gimy I guess that is where we now stand well I can read no more for a long way said Gandalf except the word gold and doran's x and something helm then barlin is now Lord of Moria that seems to end a chapter after some Stars another hand begins and I can see we

          
          15:33:09
          found true silver and later the word well forged and then something I have it mithil and the last two lines o to seek for the upper armories of third deep something go westwards a blur to holling gate Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside there are several pages of the same sort rather hastily written and much damaged he said but I can make little of them in this light now there must be a number of leaves missing because they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the colony I suppose let me see no they're too cut and

          
          15:33:56
          stained I can't them we might do better in the sunlight wait here's something a large bold hand using an Elvish script that would be A's hand said gimy looking over the Wizard's arm he could write well and speedily and often use the Elvish characters I fear he had ill Tidings to record in a fair hand said Gandalf the first clear word is sorrow but the rest of the line is lost unless it ends in estra yes it must be yes followed by day being the 10th of November barlin Lord of Moria fell in diil Dale he went alone to look in miror

          
          15:34:50
          an O shot him from behind a stone we slew the orc but many more up from East up up the Silver Load the remainder of the page is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out but I think I can read we have bar the gates and then can hold them long if and then perhaps horrible and suffer poor barlin he seems to have kept the title that it took for less than 5 years I wonder what happened afterwards but there's no time to puzzle out the last few pages here's the last page of all he paused and sigh it is grim reading he said I fear

          
          15:35:36
          their end was cruel listen we cannot get out we cannot get out they have taken the bridge in second hole fra and Loney and narly fell there then there four lines smeared so that I can only read went 5 days ago the last line runs the pool is up to the wall at Westgate The Watcher in the water took o in we cannot get out the end comes and then drums drums in the Deep I wonder what that means the last thing written is in a trailing Scroll of Elf letters they are coming there is nothing more Gandalf paused and stood in silent

          
          15:36:24
          thought a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the company we cannot get out muttered gimy it was well for us that the pool had sunk a little and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end Gandalf raised his head and looked around they seemed to have made a Last Stand by both doors he said but there were not many left by that time so ended the attempt to retake Moria it was Valiant but foolish the time has not yet come now I fear we must say farewell to barlin son of fundin he must lie in the

          
          15:37:05
          halls of his fathers we will take this book the book of mazabel and look at it more closely later you had better keep it gimy and take it back to Dean if you get a chance it will interest him though it will grieve him deeply come let us go the morning is passing which way shall we go asked back to the hall answered Gandalf but our visit to this room has not been in vain I now know where we are this must be as gimle says the Chamber of mazabel and the hall must be the 21st of the North End therefore we should leave by

          
          15:37:47
          the Eastern arch of the hall and Bear right and South and go downwards the 21st Hall should be on the seventh level that is six above the level of the gates come now back to the hall Gandalf had hardly spoken these words when there came a great noise a rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below and to tremble in the stone at their feet they sprang towards the door in alarm doom doom it rolled again as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria into a vast drum Then There came an echoing blast a

          
          15:38:26
          Great Horn was blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off there was a hurrying sound of many feet they are coming cried Legolas we cannot get out said gimy trapped cried Gandalf why did I delay here we are caught just as they were before but I was not here then we will see what doom doom came the drum beat in the wall shook slam the doors and wedge them shouted Aragon and keep your packs on as long as you can we may get a chance to cut our way out yet no said Gandalf we

          
          15:39:09
          must not get shut in keep the East door ajar we will go that way if we get a chance another harsh horn call and shrill cries rang out feet were coming down the corridor there was a ring and clatter as the company Drew their swords Glam dring Shone with a pale light and sting glinted at the edges bomir set his shoulder against the Western door wait a moment do not close it yet said Gandalf he sprang forward to bm's side and Drew himself up to his full height who comes hither to disturb the rest of bar in

          
          15:39:44
          Lord of Moria he cried in a loud voice there was A Rush of horar laughter like the fall of sliding stones into a pit amid the clamor a deep voice was raised in command doom boom doom doom went the drums in the deap with a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door and thrust forward his staff there was a dazzling flash that Lit the chamber and the passage outside for an instant the wizard looked out arrows whed and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back there are

          
          15:40:18
          many Orcs very many of them he said and some are large and evil black uruks of Mordor for the moment they are hanging back but there is something else there a great cave troll I think or more than one there's no way of Escape that way and no hope at all if they come at the other door as well said Boromir there's no sound outside here yet said Aragorn who was standing by the Eastern door listening the passage on this side plunges straight down a stair it plainly does not lead back towards the hall but it's no good flying blindly

          
          15:40:55
          this way with a Pursuit just behind we can't can't block the door its key is gone and the lock is broken and it opens inwards we must do something to delay the enemy first we will make them fear the Chamber of mazul he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword anduril heavy feet were heard in the corridor Boromir flung himself against the door and heaved it to then he wedged it with broken sword blades and splinters of wood the company retreated to the other side of the chamber but they had no chance to fly yet there was

          
          15:41:31
          a blow on the door that made it quiver and then it began to grind slowly open driving back to wedges a huge arm and shoulder with a dark skin of greeny scales was thrust through the opening Gap then a great flat tolless foot was forced through below there was a dead silence outside bomir leaped forward and hued at the arm with all his might but his sword rang glanced aside and fell from his shaken hand the blade was notched suddenly and to his own surprise froda felt a hot wroth blaze up in his

          
          15:42:08
          heart the sh he cried and springing beside baromir he stooped and stabbed with sting at the hij foot there was a Bellow and the foot jerked back nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo's arms black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor bmir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again one for the sh cried Aragorn the hobbit's bite is deep you have a good blade Frodo son of Drogo there was a crash on the door followed by crash after crash Rams and hammers were beating against it it

          
          15:42:44
          cracked and staggered back and the opening grew suddenly wide arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and fell harmlessly to the floor there was a horn blast and a rush of feet and ORS one after another leapt into the chamber how many there were the company could not count the arrae was sharp but the Orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of the defense legus shot two through the throat gimly healed the legs from under another that had sprung up on barin's Tomb Boromir and Aragon slew

          
          15:43:18
          many when 13 had fallen the rest fled shrieking leaving the Defenders unharmed except for Sam who had a scratch along the SK help a quick duck had saved him and he had failed his orc a sturdy thrust with his bow blade a fire was smoldering in his brown eyes that would have made ted sand him and step backwards if he'd seen it now is the time cried Gandalf let us go before the troll returns but even as they retreated and before Pippen and Mary had reached the stair outside a huge orc Chieftain almost manh high clad

          
          15:43:56
          in black male from head to to foot leapt into the chamber behind him his followers clustered in the doorway his broad flat face was swart his eyes were like coals and his tongue was red he wielded a great spear with a Thrust of his huge hid Shield he turned boromir's sword and bore him backwards throwing him to the ground diving under Aragorn's blow with a speed of a striking snake he charged into the company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo the blow caught him on the right side and froo was hurled against the wall and

          
          15:44:32
          pinned Sam with a cry hacked at the spear shaft and it broke and even as the orc flung down the trench and swept out his simitar anduril came down upon his Helm there was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder the orc fell with cloven head his followers fled howling as Boromir and Aragon sprang at them Doom Doom with the drums in the Deep the great voice rolled out again no shouted Gandalf now is the last chance run for it Aragon picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair

          
          15:45:11
          pushing Mery and Pippen in front of him the others followed but gimy had to be dragged Away by Legolas in spite of the Peril he lingered by barin's tomb with his head bowed bomir hauled the Eastern door two grinding upon its hinges it had great iron rings on either side but could not be fastened I'm all right gasped Frodo I can walk put me down Aragorn nearly dropped him in amazement I thought you were dead he cried not yet said gandal but there is time for Wonder off you go all of you down the stairs wait a few

          
          15:45:49
          minutes for me at the bottom if I don't come soon go on go quickly and choose paths leading right and downwards we can't leave you to hold the doors alone said Aragon do as I say said gandal fiercely swords are no more use here go the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark they groped their way down a long flight of steps and then looked back but they could see nothing except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard staff he seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door Frodo breathed heav and leaned

          
          15:46:28
          against Sam who put his arms about him they stood peering up the stairs into the darkness froo thought he could hear the voice of gandal above muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing Echo he could not catch what was said the walls seemed to be trembling every now and again the drum beats throbbed and rolled doom doom Suddenly at the top of the stairs there was a stab of white light then there was a a dull Rumble and a heavy thud the drum beats broke out wildly doom boom doom boom and then

          
          15:47:05
          stopped Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the company well well that's over said the wizard struggling to his feet I've done all that I could but I've met my match and have nearly been destroyed but don't stand here go on you'll have to do without light for a while I'm rather shaken go on go on where are you gimly come ahead with me keep close behind all of you they stumbled after him wondering what had happened doom doom went the drum beats again they now sounded muffled and F

          
          15:47:43
          away but they were following there was no other sound of pursuit neither of feet nor any voice Gandalf took no turns right or left for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired every now and again it descended a flight of steps 50 or more to a lower level at the moment that was their Chief danger for in the dark they could not see a descent until they came on it and put their feet out into emptiness gandal felt the ground with his staff like a blind man at the end of an hour they had gone

          
          15:48:21
          a mile or maybe a little more and had descended many flights of stairs there was still no sound of pursuit almost they began to hope that they would Escape at the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted it's getting hot he gasped we ought to be down at least to the level of the gates now soon I think we should look for a leftand turn to take us East I hope it's not far I'm very weary I must rest here a moment even if all the Orcs ever spawned are after us gimy took his arm and helped him down to a seat on

          
          15:48:56
          the step what happened away up there at the door he asked did you meet the beater of the drums I don't know answered Gandalf but I found myself suddenly faced by something that I've not met before I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting spell on the door I know many but to do things of that kind rightly requires time and even then the door can be broken by strength as I stood there I could hear Hawk voices on the other side at any moment I thought they would burst it open I could not

          
          15:49:31
          hear what was said they seemed to be talking in their own hidous language all I caught was K Which is far then something came into the chamber I felt it through the door and the Orcs themselves were afraid and silent I laid hold of the iron ring and then it perceived me and my spell what it was I cannot guess but I have never felt such a challenge the count her spell was terrible it nearly broke me for an instant the door left my control and began to open I had to speak a word of command that proved too great a strain

          
          15:50:09
          the door burst in pieces something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside and I was thrown backwards down the stairs all the wall gave way and the roof of the chamber as well I think I'm afraid baring this very deep and maybe something else is bued there too I cannot say but at least the passage behind us was completely blocked uh I've never felt so spent but it's passing and now what about you fro there was not time to say so but I've never been more delighted in my life than when

          
          15:50:46
          you spoke I feared that it was a brave but dead Hobbit that Aragorn was carrying what about me said Frodo I'm alive and whole I think I'm bruised and in pain but it's not too bad well said Aragorn I can only say that Hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that I've never met the like of it had I known I would have spoken softer in the in debris that spear thrust would have skewed a wild boar well it didn't skew me I'm glad to say said Frodo though I feel as if I'd been caught between a hammer and an

          
          15:51:23
          anvil he said no more he found breathing brething painful you take after Bilbo said Gandalf there's more about you than meets the eye as I said of him long ago Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said they now went on again before long gimy spoke he had Keen eyes in the dark I think he said that there is a light ahead but it's not daylight it's red what can it be gosh muttered Gandalf I wonder if that is what they meant that the lower levels are on Far still we can only go on soon the light became unmistakable and could

          
          15:52:10
          be seen by all it was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them they could now see their way in front the road sloped down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a low Archway through it the glowing light came the the air became very hot when they came to the arch Gandalf went through signing to them to wait as he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glow quickly he stepped back there is some new devilry here he said devised for our welcome no doubt

          
          15:52:48
          but I know now where we are we have reached the first deep the level immediately below the gates this is a second Hall of old Moria and the gates are near away beyond the Eastern end on the left not more than a quarter of a mile across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide Road through the first Hall and out but come and look they peered out before them was another cavernous Hall it was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept they were near its eastern end Westward had ran away Into

          
          15:53:24
          Darkness down the center stalked double line of towering pillars they were carved like bowls of Mighty trees whose bows upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone their stems were smooth and black but a red glow was Darkly mirrored in their sides right across the floor close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened out of it a fierce red light came and now and again Flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot

          
          15:53:58
          air if we had come by the main road down from the upper Halls we should have been trapped here said Gandalf let us hope that the far Now lies between us and pursuit come there's no time to lose even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom away beyond the Shadows at the Western end of the hall there came cries and Horn calls doom doom the pillar seemed to tremble and the Flames to quiver now for the last race said Gandalf if the sun is shining outside we may still Escape

          
          15:54:35
          after me he turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall the distance was greater than it had looked as they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind a shrill yell went up they had been seen there was a ring and a clash of Steel an arrow whistled over Frodo's head bmir laughed they did not expect this he said the fire has cut them off we're on the wrong side look ahead called Gandalf the bridge is near it is dangerous and narrow suddenly Frodo saw before him a Black Chasm at the end of the hall the

          
          15:55:14
          floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth the outer door could only be reached by a slender Bridge of stone without curb or rail that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of 50 ft it was an ancient defense of the dwarves against any enemy that might capture the first Hall on the outer passages they could only pass across it in single file at the brink Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind lead the way gimly he said Pippen and marry next straight on and up the stair behind the door arrows fell among

          
          15:55:50
          them one struck Frodo and sprang back another pierced Gandalf's hat and stuck there like a black feather Frodo looked behind beyond the far he saw swarming black figures there seemed to be hundreds of Orcs they brandished Spears and scimitars which Shone red as blood in the thight doom doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and louder doom doom Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though it was a long shot for his small bow he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the crowd he

          
          15:56:27
          gave a cry of dismay and fear two great trolls appeared they bore great slabs of stone and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire but it was not the trolls that had filled the elf with Terror the ranks of the Orcs had opened and they crowded away as if they themselves were afraid something was coming up behind them what it was could not be seen it was like a great shadow in the middle of which was a dark form of man shape maybe yet greater and a power and Terror seemed to be in it and

          
          15:57:04
          to go before it it came to the edge of the far and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it then with a rush it leaped across the fisure the Flames roared up to greet it and wathed about it and a black smoke swirled the air its streaming man kindled and blazed behind it in its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs I hi well Legolas a BAL Rong a BAL Rong is come kimly stared with wide eyes durin's Bane he cried and letting his ax fall he covered his face a bell

          
          15:57:52
          rug muttered Gandalf now I understand he faled and leaned heavily on his staff what an evil fortune and I am already weary the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them the Orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways then Boromir raised his horn and blew loud the challenge rang and billowed like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof for a moment the Orcs quailed And the fiery Shadow halted then The Echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind and the enemy

          
          15:58:31
          advanced again over the bridge cried gandal recalling his strength fly this is a foe Beyond any of you I must hold the net away fly Aragorn and Boromir did not heed the command but still held their ground side by side behind gandal at the far end of the bridge the others halted just within the doorway at the Hall's end and turned unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone the balrog reached the bridge Gandalf stood in the middle of thean leaning on the staff in his left hand but in his other

          
          15:59:08
          hand glamdring gleamed cold and white his enemy halted again facing him and the shadow about it reached out like two vast Wings it raised the Whip and the thongs whined and cracked fire came from its nostrils but Gandalf stood firm you cannot pass he said the orc Stood Still and a dead silence fell I am servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of aror you cannot pass the dark fire will not Avail you flame of Odun go back to the shadow you cannot pass the Bal Rog made no answer the fire in it seemed to die but the darkness

          
          15:59:55
          grew it stepped forward slowly onto the bridge and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height and its wings were spread from wall to wall but Gandalf could be seen glimmering in the Gloom he seemed small and all together alone gray and bent like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm from Out of The Shadow a red sword leaped flaming claming glittered white in answer there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire the Bell Rog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments the wizard swayed on the

          
          16:00:33
          bridge stepped back a pace and then again Stood Still you cannot pass he said with a bound the bog leapt full upon the bridge its whip Whirled and hissed he cannot stand alone cried Aragon suddenly and ran back along the bridge elendil he shouted I am with you Gandalf Gondor cried Boromir and leapt after him at that moment Gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud he smoked the bridge before him the staff broke aunder and fell from his hand a blinding sheet of White Flame sprang up the bridge cracked right at the Bell rog's feet it

          
          16:01:16
          broke and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the Gulf while the rest remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock Thrust out into empty with a terrible Cry The Bog fell forward and its shadow plunged down and vanished but even as it fell it swung its Whip and the thongs lashed and curled about the Wizard's knees dragging him to the brink he staggered and fell grasped vainly at the stone and slid into the abyss fly you fools he cried and was gone the fires went out and blank Darkness fell the company stood rooted

          
          16:01:56
          with horror staring into the pit even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying back the rest of the bridge cracked and fell with a cry Aragon roused them come I will lead you now he called we must obey his last command follow me they stumbled wildly up the great stairs Beyond the Door Aragon leading Boromir at the rear at the top was a wide echoing passage along this they fled Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran doom doom doom the drum beats rolled behind

          
          16:02:33
          mournful now and slow Doom they ran on the light grew before them great shafts pierced the roof they ran swifter they passed into a hall bright with daylight from its high windows in the East they fled across it through its huge broken doors they passed and suddenly before them the great Gates opened and arch of Blazing light there was a guard Of Orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great doorposts towering on either side but the gates were shattered and cast down Aragorn smoked to the ground the

          
          16:03:09
          captain that stood in his path and the rest fled in Terror of his wroth the company swept past them and took no heed of them out of the gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age-worn steps the threshold of Moria thus at last they came Beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on their faces they did not halt until they were out to Bow shot from the walls diil Dale lay about them the shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it but eastwards there was a golden light on the land it was but 1 hour afternoon the Sun was

          
          16:03:49
          shining the clouds were white and high they looked back dark yawned the AR way of the gates Under the Mountain Shadow faint and far beneath the Earth rolled the slow drum beats Doom a thin black smoke trailed out nothing else was to be seen the Dale all around was empty Doom grief at last wholly overcame them and they wept long some standing and Silent some cast upon the ground doom doom the drum beats faded chapter 6 Loth laan alas I fear we cannot stay here longer said Aragon he looked towards the

          
          16:04:43
          mountains and held up his sword farewell Gandalf he cried did I not say to you if you pass the doors of Moria beware Al last that I spoke spoke true what hope have we without you he turned to the company we must do without hope he said at least we may yet be Avenged let us G ourselves and weep no more come we have a long road and much to do they Rose and looked about them northward the Dale ran up into a Glenn of Shadows between two great arms of the mountains above which three white Peaks were

          
          16:05:24
          shining Caleb still THU withal kathas the mountains of Moria at the head of the Glenn a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short Falls and a mist of foam hung in the air above the Mountain's feet Yonder is the diil stair said Aragon pointing to the falls down the deep clov and way that climbs beside the torrent we should have come if Fortune had been kinder oh kathas L cruel said gim there he stands smiling in the sun he shook his fist at the furthest of the snowcapped Peaks and turned

          
          16:06:07
          away to the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end and far lands could be described Beyond them wide and vague to the South the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach less than a mile away and a little below them for they still stood high up on the west side of the Dale there lay a mirr it was long and oval shaped like a great spearhead thrust deep into the northern Glenn but its southern end was beyond the Shadows under the sunlet sky yet its Waters were

          
          16:06:44
          dark a deep blue like clear evening Sky its face was still and unruffled about it lay a smooth sword shelving down on all sides to its B unbroken Rim there lies the miroir deepar said gimy sadly I remember that he said may you have joy of the sight but we cannot linger there now long shall I Journey here I have joy again it is I that must hasten away and he that must remain the company now went down the road from the gates it was rough and broken fading to a winding track between Heather and wind that

          
          16:07:30
          thrust amid the cracking stones but still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf Kingdom in places there were ruined works of stone beside the path and mounds of green topped with Slender Birches or fur trees sighing in the wind an Eastern Bend LED them hard by the sword of miramir and they not far far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the top that is during Stone cried gimy I cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to look at The Wonder of the

          
          16:08:07
          Dale be swift then said Aragon looking back towards the gates the sun sinks early the Orcs will not maybe come out till after darkk but we must be far away before nightfall the Moon is almost spent and it will be dark tonight come with me Frodo cried the dwarf springing from the road I would not have you go without seeing heled arum he ran down the long green slope Frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness Sam came up behind beside the standing Stone gimy

          
          16:08:47
          halted and looked up it was cracked and weather-worn and the faint runes upon its side could not be read this pillar marks the spot where Doran first looked in the mid miror said the dwarf let us look ourselves once here we go they stooped over the dark water at first they could see nothing then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue and the Peaks were like plumes of White Flame above them Beyond there was a space of Sky there like Jewels sunk in the Deep

          
          16:09:25
          sh glinting Stars though sunlight was in the sky above of their own stooping forms no Shadow could be seen oh heled zaram fair and wonderful said gim there lies the crown of durin till he wakes farewell he bowed and turned away and hastened back up the green sword to the road again what did you see said Pippen to Sam but Sam was too deep in to answer the road now turned South and went quickly downwards running out from between the arms of the Dale some way below the mirror they came on a deep well of water clear as Crystal from

          
          16:10:11
          which a freshet fell over a Stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep Rocky channel here is the spring from which the Silver Load arises said gimy do not drink of it it is icy cold soon it becomes a swift River and it gathers water from many other Mountain Streams said Aragorn our road leads beside it for many miles for I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose and first I hope to come to the woods where the silverload flows into the Great River out yonder they looked as he pointed and before them they could

          
          16:10:49
          see the stream leaping down to the trough of the valley and then running on and Away into the lower lands until it was lost in a golden haze there lie the woods of lothan said Legolas that is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people there are no trees like the Trees of that land for in the Autumn their leaves fall not but turn to Gold not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall and then the bows are Laden with yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden and golden is the roof and its

          
          16:11:27
          pillars out of silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and gray so still our songs in MK would say my heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood and it was Springtime my heart will be glad even in the winter said Aragon but it lies many miles away let us hasten for some time Frodo and S managed to keep up with the others but Aragon was leading them at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind they had eaten nothing since the early morning Sam's cut was burning like fire

          
          16:12:09
          and his head felt light in spite of The Shining Sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria he shivered throo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath at last Legolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to Aragon the others halted and Aragorn ran back calling to bmir to come with him I'm sorry Frodo he cried full of concern so much has happened this day and we have such need of haste that I've forgotten that you were hurt and Sam too you should have spoken we've done

          
          16:12:52
          nothing to ease you as we ought though all the of Moria were after us come now a little further on there is a place where we can rest for a little there I will do what I can for you come Boromir we'll carry them soon afterwards They Came Upon another stream that ran down from the west and joined its bubbling water with a hurrying silverload together they plunged over a fall of green hued stone and foamed down into a Dell about it stood fur trees short and bent and its sides were Steep and clothed with heart's tongue and

          
          16:13:32
          shrubs of wle Berry at the bottom there was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining Pebbles here they rested it was now nearly 3 hours afternoon and they had come only a few miles from the gates already the sun was westering while gimlin and the two younger Hobbits kindled a fire of Brushwood and fur and Drew water Aragon tended Sam and Frodo Sam's wound was not deep but it looked ugly and Aragon's face was grave as he examined it after a moment he looked up with relief good luck Sam he said many have

          
          16:14:17
          received worse than this in payment for the slaying of their first orc the cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often are it should heal well when I've tended it bathe it when gimle has heated water he opened his pouch and Drew out some withered leaves they are dry and some of their virtue has gone he said but here I have still some of the leaves of aralas that I gathered near weathertop Crush one in the water and wash the wound clean and I will bind it now it's your turn Frodo I'm all right said Frodo reluctant

          
          16:15:01
          to have his garments touched all I needed was some food and a little rest no said Aragon we must have a look and see what the hammer and the Anvil have done to you I still Marvel that you are alive at all gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket and worn tunic and gave a gasp of Wonder then he laughed the silver Cor corselet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a Rippling sea carefully he took it off and held it up and the gems on it glittered like stars and the sound of the Shak and Rings was like the tinkle of rain in a

          
          16:15:39
          pool look my friends he called he has a pretty Hobbit skin to wrap an Elven prining in if it were known that Hobbits had such hides all the hunters of Middle Earth would be riding to the sh and all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain said gimy gazing at the maale in Wonder it's a myth coat myril I've never seen or heard a tell of one so fair is this the coat that gandal spoke of then he undervalued it but it was well given I've often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing so close in his little

          
          16:16:20
          room said Mary bless the old Hobbit I love him more than ever I hope we get a chance of telling him about it there was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather but at one point the Rings had been driven through it into the flesh Frodo's left side also was scored and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall while the others set the food ready Adorn bathed the Herz with water in which aalas was steeped the pungent fragrance filled the dell and all those

          
          16:17:01
          who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened soon Frodo felt the pain leave him and his breath grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side the mail is marvelously light he said Put it on again if you can it my heart is glad to know that you have such a coat do not lay it aside even in sleep unless Fortune brings you where you are safe for a while and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts when they had eaten the company

          
          16:17:42
          got ready to go on they put out the fire and hid all traces of it then climbing out of the Dell they took to the road again they had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward Heights and great Shadows crept down the mountain sides dusk veiled their feet and Mist Rose in the hollows away in the East the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood Sam and Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair pace and with only one brief halt Aragon led the company on for nearly

          
          16:18:23
          three more hours it was dark deep night had fallen there were many clear stars but the fast waning moon would not be seen till late gimly and Frodo were at the rear walking softly and not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind at length gimly broke the silence not a sound but the wind he said there are no goblins near or my ears made of wood it's to be hoped that the Orcs will be content with driving us from Mor here and maybe that was all their purpose and they had nothing else to do with us with the

          
          16:19:09
          ring though Orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into the plane if they have a fallen Captain to avenge Frodo didn't answer he looked at sting and the blade was dull yet he had heard something or thought had as soon as the Shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick patter of feet even now he heard it he turned swiftly there were two tiny gleams of light behind or for a moment he thought he saw them but at once they slipped aside and vanished what is it said the dwarf I don't know

          
          16:19:50
          answered Frodo I thought I heard feet and I thought I saw a light like eyes I have thought so often since we first entered Moria gimle halted and stooped to the ground I hear nothing but the night speech of plant and stone he said come let us hurry the others are out of sight the night wind blew chill up the valley to meet them before them a wide gray Shadow loomed and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like popers the breeze Loth laan cried legus Loth laan we have come to the eaves of the golden

          
          16:20:33
          wood Al last that it is winter under the night the trees stood tall before them arched over the road and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs in the dim light of the Stars their stems were gray and their quivering leaves a hint of fellow gold lothan said Aragon glad I am to hear again the wind in the trees we are still little more than five leagues from the gates but we can go no further here let us hope that the virtue of the elves will keep us tonight from the Peril that comes

          
          16:21:08
          behind if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening World said gimy it's long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages long ago said Legolas but we hear that laan is not yet deserted for there is a secret power here that holds evil from the land nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell now deep in the woods and far from the northern border indeed deep in the wood they dwell said Aragon and sighed as if some memory stirred in him we must fend for

          
          16:21:49
          ourselves tonight we will go forward a short way until the trees are all about us and then we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest in he stepped forward but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow is there no other way he said what other Fair way would you desire said Aragon a plain road though it led through a hedge of Swords said Boromir by strange paths has this company been LED and so far to evil Fortune against my will we passed under the shades of Moria to our loss and now we

          
          16:22:30
          must enter the golden wood you say but of that perilous Land We Have Heard in Gondor and it is said that few come out who once go in and of that few none have escaped unscathed say not unscathed but if you say unchanged then maybe you will speak the truth said Aragon but l ways in Gondor Boromir if in the city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlorian believe what you will there is no other way for US unless you would go back to Moria gate or scale the pathless mountains or swim the Great

          
          16:23:13
          River all alone then lead on said Boromir but it is perilous perilous indeed said Aragon fair and perilous but only evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them follow me they had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree clad slopes that climbed back Westward toward the mountains they heard it splashing over a Fall Away among the Shadows on their right its dark hurrying Waters ran across the path before them and joined

          
          16:23:55
          the silverload in a swirl of dim pools among the roots of trees here is Nimrodel said Legolas of this stream the silveren elves made many songs long ago and still we sing them in the north remembering the Rainbow on its Falls and the golden flowers that floated in its foam all is dark now and the bridge of Nimrodel is broken down I will bathe my feet for it is said that the water his healing to the weary he went forward and climbed down the Deep cloven bank and stepped into the stream follow me he cried the water is

          
          16:24:36
          not deep let us wait across on the further Bank we can rest and the sound of the falling water may bring us sleep and forgetfulness of grief one by one they climbed down and followed legalis for a moment Frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet it was cold but its touch was clean and as he went on and it mounted to his knees he felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs when all the company had crossed they sat and rested and ate a little

          
          16:25:14
          food and legalis told them Tales of lothlorian that the elves of merkwood still kept in their hearts of sunlight and starlight on The Meadows by the Great River before the world was gray at length the silence fell and they heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadows almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing mingled with a sound of the water do you hear the voice of nim Rodell asked Legolas I will sing you a song of the maiden Nimrodel Who Bore the same name as the stream

          
          16:25:52
          beside which she lived long ago it is a fair song in our Woodland tongue but this is how it runs in the western speech as some in rivendel Now sing it in a voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he began an elen made there was of old a Shining Star by day a mantle white was hemmed with gold her shoes of silver gray a star was bound upon her brows a light was on her hair as Sun upon the golden bows in loran the fair her hair was long her limbs were white and fair she was and free and in

          
          16:26:42
          the wind she went as light as Leaf of Lind and tree beside the Falls of nim rodel by water clear and cool her voice of falling silver fell into The Shining pool where now she wanders none can tell in sunlight or in shade for lost of your was Nim Rodell and in the mountain stray the Elven ship in Haven gray beneath the mountain Le awaited her for many a day beside the Roar in Sea a wind by night in Northern lands arose and loud it cried and drove the ship from Elven strands across the streaming tide when Dawn came dim the

          
          16:27:41
          land was lost the mountain sinking gray beyond the heaving waves that toss their plumes of blinding spray amroth beheld The Fading Shore now low beyond the swell and cursed the faithless ship that bore him far from Lim rodel of old he was an Elven King a lord of tree and Glenn where golden were the bows in spring in fth from Helm to see they saw him leap as Arrow from the string and die into the water deep as Mew upon the wing the wind was in his flowing hair the fo about him sha AAR they saw him strong

          
          16:28:38
          and fair go riding like a swan but from the West has come no word and on the hether shore no Tidings elen folk have heard of AR Roth ever more the voice of Legolas faltered and the song ceased I cannot sing anymore he said that is but a part for I have forgotten much it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow Came Upon Loth lauan lauan of the blossom when the dwarves awakened evil in the mountains but the dwarves did not make the evil said gimy I said not not so yet evil came answered Legolas sadly then many of the

          
          16:29:30
          elves of nimad Del's Kindred left their dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the south in the passes of the White Mountains and she came not to the ship where amroth her lover waited for her but in the spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by the fs that bear her name and when the wind is in the South the voice of amroth comes up from the sea for Nimrodel flows into silverload that elves call cant and cant into andwin the great and andwin flows into

          
          16:30:08
          the Bay of belfalas when the elves of lauran set sail but neither Nimrodel nor amroth ever came back it is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew near the falls for that was the custom of the elves of lauran to dwell in the trees and maybe it is so still therefore they were called the gatham the tree people deep in their Forest the trees are very great the people of the woods did not delve in the ground like dwarves nor build strong places of stone before the shadow

          
          16:30:47
          came and even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought safer than sitting on the ground said gimly he looked across the stream to the road that led back to dimal Dale and then up into the roof of dark boughs above your words bring Good Counsel gimy said Aragorn we can't build a house but tonight we'll do as a gatham and seek refuge in the Treetops if we can we have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise the company now turned the side from the path and went into the shadow

          
          16:31:25
          of the deeper Woods Westward along the mountain stream away from silverload not far from the folds of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees some of which overhung the stream their great great trunks were of Mighty Earth but their height could not be guessed I will climb up said legalis I'm at home among trees by root or bow though these trees are of a Kind strange to me save as a name in song melon they're called and of those that bear the yellow Blossom but I have never climbed in one I will see now what

          
          16:32:06
          is their shape and way of growth whatever it may be said Pippen they will be marvelous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at night except to birds I can't sleep on a perch then dig a hole in the ground said legus if that is more after the fashion of your kind but you must dig Swift and deep if you wish to hide from Orcs he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch That Grew From the trunk high above his head but even as he swung there for a moment a voice spoke suddenly from the tree Shadows above

          
          16:32:43
          him daro it said in commanding tone and legus dropped back to Earth in Surprise and fear he shrank against the bowl of the tree stand still he whispered to the others do not move or speak there was a sound of soft laughter over their heads and then another clear voice spoke in an Elven tongue throo could understand little of what was said for the speech that the silen folk east of the mountains used among themselves was unlike that of the West Legolas looked up and answered in the same language who are they and what do they

          
          16:33:23
          say asked asked Mar they're elves said Sam can't you hear their voices yes they are elves said lius and they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot you in the dark Sam hastily put his hand over his mouth but they say also that you need have no fear they have been aware of us for a long while they heard my voice across the Nimrodel and knew that I was one of their Northern kindred and therefore they did not hinder our Crossing and afterwards they heard my song now they bit me climb up with rodo for they seem

          
          16:34:03
          to have had some Tidings of him and of our journey the others they asked to wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree until they have decided what is to be done out of the Shadows a ladder was let down it was made of rope silver gray and glimmering in the dark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to Bear many men Legolas ran lightly up and Frodo followed slowly behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly the branches of the malor tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk and then

          
          16:34:39
          swept upwards for near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform or flate as such things were called in those days the the elves called it a Talan it was reached by a round hole in the center through which the ladder passed when Frodo came at last up onto the flet he found legola seated with three other elves they were clad in shadowy Gray and could not be seen among the tree stems unless they moved suddenly they stood up and one of them

          
          16:35:18
          uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam he held it up looking at Frodo's face and Sam's then he shut off the light again and spoke words of Welcome in his Elven tongue Frodo spoke haltingly in return welcome the elf then said again in the common language speaking slowly we seldom use any tongue but our own for we dwell now in the heart of the forest and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk even our own Kindred in the north has suered from us but there are some of us still who go abroad for

          
          16:35:56
          the Gathering of news and the watching of our enemies and they speak the languages of other lands I am one Hower is my name my brothers ril and Orin speak little of your tongue but we have heard rumors of your coming for the messengers of Eland passed by lauan on their way home up the diil stair we had not heard of Hobbits or halflings for many a long year and did not know that any yet dwelt in Middle Earth you do not look evil and since you come with an elf of our Kindred we are willing to befriend you

          
          16:36:36
          as Elon asked though it is not our custom to lead strangers through our land but you must stay here tonight how many are you eight said Legolas myself four Hobbits and two men one of whom Aragorn is a friend of the folk of westernness the name of Aragon son of arathor is known in lauran said Haler and he has the favor of the lady all then is well that you have yet spoken only of seven the eighth is a dwarf said Legolas a dwarf said halder that is not well we have not had dealings with the dwarves

          
          16:37:21
          since the dark days they are not permitted in our land I cannot allow him to pass but he is from the Lonely Mountain one of Dan's trusty people and friendly to Elon said Frodo Elon himself chose him to be one of our Companions and he has been brave and faithful the elves spoke together in soft voices and questioned Legolas in their own tongue very good said Haler at last we will do this though it is against our liking if aror and Legolas will guard him and answer for him he shall pass but he must go blindfold through Loth

          
          16:38:03
          laan but now we must debate no longer your folk must not remain on the ground we've been keeping watch on the rivers ever since we saw a great troop Of Orcs going North toward Moria along the skirts of the mountains many days ago wolves are howling on the woods borders if you have indeed come from Moria the Peril cannot be far behind tomorrow early you must go on the four Hobbit shall climb up here and stay with us we do not fear them there is another Talan in the next tree there the others must

          
          16:38:39
          take refuge you Legolas must answer to us for them call us if anything is a miss and have an eye on that dwarf Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Hal's message and soon afterwards medy and Pippen clambered up onto the high flet they were out of breath and seemed rather scared there said Mary panting we've lugged up your blankets as well as our own Strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift of leaves you had no need of your burdens said Haler it is cold in the Treetops in

          
          16:39:18
          Winter though the wind tonight is in the South but we have food and drink to give you that will drive away the night chill and we have skins and cloaks to spare the hbits accepted this second and far better supper very gladly then they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the fur cloaks of the elves but in their own blankets as well and tried to go to sleep but weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep upstairs even when they have any stairs the flet

          
          16:39:55
          was not at all to their liking as a bedroom it had no walls not even a rail only on one side was there a light plattered screen which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind Pippin went on talking for a while I hope if I do go to sleep in this bed Loft that I sh roll off he said once I do get to sleep said Sam I shall go on sleep sleeping whether I roll off or no and the less said the sooner I'll drop off if you take my meaning Frodo lay for some time awake and looked up at the stars glinting

          
          16:40:36
          through the pale roof of quivering leaves Sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes he could dimly see the gray forms of two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking in Whispers the other had gone down down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches At Last lulled by the wind in the bows above and the sweet murmur of the fs of Nimrodel below Frodo fell asleep with the song of Legolas running in his mind late in the night he awoke the other Hobbits were asleep the elves were

          
          16:41:15
          gone the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves the wind was still a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below there was a ring of metal The Sounds died slowly away and seemed to go Southward on into the wood a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet Frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a gry hooded elf he looked towards the hobbits what is it said Frodo yes said the elf in a ing whisper and cast onto the flet the rope ladder rolled

          
          16:41:58
          up Orcs said Frodo what are they doing but the elf had gone there were no more sounds even the leaves were silent and the Very Falls seemed to be arched Frodo sat and shivered in his WPS he was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground but he felt that the trees offered little protection except concealment Orcs were as Keen as hounds on a scent it was said but they could also climb he drew out sting it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull in spite of the

          
          16:42:38
          fading of his sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave Frodo rather it grew stronger he got up and crawled to the opening and peered down he was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the trees foot far below not elves for the Woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk he stared down into the dark holding his breath something was now climbing slowly

          
          16:43:15
          and its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth then coming up close to the stem Frodo saw two pale eyes they stopped and gazed upward unwinking suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figure slipped around the trunk of the tree and vanished immediately afterwards hir came climbing swiftly up through the branches there was something in this tree that I've never seen before he said it was not an orc it fled as soon as I touched the tree stem it seemed to be wary and to have some skill in trees or

          
          16:43:53
          I might have have thought that it was one of your Hobbits I did not shoot for I dared not arouse any cries we cannot risk a battle a strong company Of Orcs has passed they crossed the Nimrodel cursed their foul feet in its clean water and went on down the old road beside the river they seemed to pick up some scent and they searched the ground for a while near the place where you halted the three of us could not challenge a 100 so we went to head and spoke with faint voices leading them on into the

          
          16:44:27
          wood Oren has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people none of the Orcs will ever return out of lauran and there will be many elves hidden on the northern border before another nightfalls but you must take the road South as soon as it is fully light day came pale from the East as the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves of the Malon and it seemed to the hobbits that the early Sun of a cool Summer's morning was shining pale blue sky peeped among the moving branches looking through an opening on

          
          16:45:05
          the south side of the flet fro saw all the valleys of the silver lying like a sea of fellow gold tossing gently in the breeze the morning was still young and cold when the company set out again guided Now by Haler and his brother ril Fair well sweet Nim Rodell cried Legolas Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the gray tree stems farewell he said it seemed to him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful forever blending its innumerable notes in an endless changeful

          
          16:45:45
          music they went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the silverload and for some way they followed it Southward there were the prince of orc feet in the Earth but soon halia turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river under their Shadows there is one of my people Yonder across the stream he said though you may not see him he gave a call like the low whistle of a bird and out of a Thicket of young trees an elf stepped clad in Gray but with his hood thrown back his

          
          16:46:19
          hair glinted like gold in the morning sun how skillfully cast Over The Stream a coil of gray rope and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank celebrant is already a strong stream here as you see said Haler and it runs both Swift and deep and is very cold we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must but in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges this is how we cross follow me he made his end of the Rope fast about another tree and then ran lightly along it over

          
          16:46:58
          the river and back again as if he were on a road I could walk this path said Legolas but the others have not this skill must they swim no said halier we have two more ropes we will fasten them above the other one shoulder high and another half high and holding these The Stranger should be able to cross with care when this slender the bridge had been made the company passed over some cautiously and slowly others more easily of the hobbits Pippin proved the best for he was surefooted and he walked over

          
          16:47:34
          quickly holding only with one hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down Sam shuffled along clutching hard and looking down into the pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mountains he breathed with relief when he was safely across live and learn as my geffer used to say though he was thinking of gardening not a roosting like a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider not even my Uncle Andy ever did a trick like that when at length all the company was gathered on the East Bank of

          
          16:48:11
          the Silver Load the elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them ril who had remained on the other side Drew back the last one slung it on his shoulder and with a wave of his hand went away back to Nimrodel to keep watch now friends said halier you have entered the N of lauran or the Gore as you would say for it's the land that lies like a spearhead between the arms of silverload and andwin the great we allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the nth few indeed are permitted ever to set foot

          
          16:48:49
          there as was agreed I shall hear blindfold the eyes of gim the dwarf The Others May walk free for a while until we come nearer to our dwellings down in egil in the angle between the waters this was not at all to the liking of gimy the agreement was made without my consent he said I will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner and I am no spy my folk have never had dealings with any of the Servants of the enemy neither have we done harm to the elves I am no more likely to betray you than Legolas or any other of my

          
          16:49:32
          companions I do not doubt you said Haler yet this is our law I am not the master of the law and cannot set it aside I have done much in letting you set foot over celebrant gimy was obstinate he planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand upon the half of his axe I will go forward free he said or I will go back and seek my own land where I am known to be true of word though I perish alone in the wilderness you cannot go back said halia sternly now you have come thus far you must be brought before the Lord and

          
          16:50:13
          the lady they shall judge you to hold you or to give you leave as they will you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there are now secret sent that you cannot pass you would be slain before you saw them gimle drew his axe from his belt Haler and his companions bent their bows a plague on dwarves and their stiff necks said Legolas come said Aragon if I am still to lead this company you must do as I bid it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out we will all be blindfold even Legolas that

          
          16:50:51
          will be best though it will make the journey slow and dull gimy laughed suddenly a merry troop of fools we shall look we hir lead us all on a string like many blind Beggars with one dog but I will be content if only legus here shares my blindness I am an elf and a Kinsman here said Legolas becoming angry in his turn now let us cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves said Aragon but the company shall all fare alike come bind our eyes Haler I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe if you do not

          
          16:51:33
          lead us well said gimbley as they bound a cloth about his eyes you will have no claim said halir I shall lead you well and the paths are smooth and straight alas for the Folly of these days said Legolas here all our enemies of the one enemy and yet I must walk blind while the sun is Mery in the Woodland under leaves of gold Folly it may seem said Haler indeed in nothing is the power of the dark lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him yet so little faith and trust do we find

          
          16:52:13
          now in the world Beyond Loth laan unless maybe in rivendel that we dare not by our own trust endanger Our Land we live now upon an island amid many perils and our hands are more often upon the bowring than upon the harp the rivers long defended us but they are a sure guard no more for the shadow has crept northward all about us some speak of departing yet for that it already seems too late the mountains to the West are growing evil to the east the lands are waste and full of s and creatures and it is rumored that we

          
          16:52:51
          cannot now safely flip pass Southward through Rohan and the mouths of the Great River are watched by the enemy even if we could come to the shores of the sea we should find no longer any shelter there it is said that there are still havens of the High Elves but they are far north and west beyond the land of the halflings but where that may be though the Lord and Lady may know I do not you ought at least to guess since you have seen us said Mary be elf Havens west of my land the Shire where hobbits

          
          16:53:27
          live happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea said Haler it is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it yet still we remember it in song Tell Me of these Havens as we walk I cannot said Mary I've never seen them I've never been out of my own land before and if I had known what the world outside was like I don't think I should have had the heart to leave it not even to see Fair Loth laan said Haler the world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places but

          
          16:54:06
          still there is much that is fair and though in all lands Love Is Now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater some there are among us who sing that the shadow will draw back and peace shall come again yet I do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as it was of old or the light of the Sun as it was a four time for the elves I fear it will prove at best a truce in which they may pass to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle Earth forever alas for looran that I love it would be a poor life in a land where no

          
          16:54:45
          malor grew but if there are melon trees beyond the great sea none have reported it as they spoke thus the company filed slowly along the paths in the wood led by Haler while the other elf walked behind they felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft and after a while they walked more freely without fear of hurt or fall being deprived of sight Frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpened he could smell the trees and the trotten grass he could hear many different notes in the rustle

          
          16:55:20
          of the leaves overhead the river murmuring way on his right and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky he felt the sun upon his face and hands when they passed through an open Glade as soon as he set foot upon the far Bank of silverload a strange feeling had come upon him and it deepened as he walked on into the knif it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Elder days and was now walking in a world that was no more in rivendel there was memory of of ancient

          
          16:55:53
          things and lauan the ancient things still lived on in the waking World evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been known the elves feared and distrusted the world outside wolves were howling on the woods borders but on the land of lauran no Shadow lay all that day the company marched on until they felt the cool evening come and heard the early night wind Whispering among many leaves then they rested and slept without fear upon the ground for their guides would not permit them to unbind their eyes and

          
          16:56:31
          they couldn't climb in the morning they went on again walking without haste at noon they halted and Frodo was aware that they had passed out Under The Shining Sun suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him a marching host of elves had come up silently they were hastening toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria and they brought news some of which hir reported the marauding Orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed the remnant had fled Westward towards the

          
          16:57:10
          mountains and were being pursued a strange creature also had been seen running with bent back and with hands near the ground like a beast and yet not of Beast shape it had a did capture and they had not shot it not knowing whether it was good or ill and it had vanished down the silverload Southwood also said halir they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of the gatham you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimy it seems that the lady knows who and what is each member of your company new messages have come from

          
          16:57:49
          rivendel perhaps he removed the B first from gim's eyes your pardon he said bowing low look on us now with friendly eyes look and be glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the Trees of the N of lauan since Duran's day when his eyes were in turn uncovered Frodo looked up and caught his breath they were standing in an open space to the left stood a great Mound covered with a sword of grass as green as Springtime in the Elder days upon it as a double crown grew two Circles of trees the outer had bark of snowy white and

          
          16:58:33
          were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner Were malor Trees of great height still arrayed in pale gold high amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the center of all there gleamed a white flet at the feet of the trees and all about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars among them nodding on Slender stalks were other flowers white and palest green they glimmered as a Mist amid the rich Hue of the grass over all the sky was blue and the sun of

          
          16:59:12
          afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green Shadows beneath the trees behold you are come to K in Arro said halir for this is the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago and here is the mound of amroth where in happier days his High House was built here ever Bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass the yellow Elanor and the pale nfil here we will stay a while and come to the city of the gatham at dusk the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass but Frodo stood a while

          
          16:59:57
          still lost in Wonder it seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished World a light was upon it for which his language had no name all that he saw was shapely but the shapes seemed at once clearcut as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes and ancient as if they had endured for forever he saw no color but those he knew gold and white and blue and green but they were fresh and poignant as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them

          
          17:00:35
          names new and wonderful in winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring no blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the Earth on the land of lauran there was no stain he turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him looking around with a puzzled expression and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake it's sunlight and bright day right enough he said I thought that elves were all for moon and stars but this is more Elvish than anything I ever heard tell

          
          17:01:16
          of I feel as if I was inside a song If you take my meaning alir looked at them and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word he smiled you feel the power of the lady of the gatham he said would it please you to climb with me up kin amroth they followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass clad slopes though he walked and breathed and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same Cool Wind as fanned his face Frodo felt that he was in a Timeless land that did not fade or

          
          17:01:56
          change or fall into forgetfulness when he had gone and passed again into the outer world still Frodo The Wanderer from the Sha would walk there upon the grass among Eleanor and eil in fth laan they entered the circle of white trees as they did so the south wind blew upon kin amroth and sigh among the branches thodos Stood Still hearing far off great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away and seabirds crying whose race had perished from the earth halia had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet as Frodo

          
          17:02:39
          prepared to follow him he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree skin and of the life within it he felt a delight in wood and the touch of it neither as Forester nor as Carpenter it was the Delight of the living tree itself as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform Hower took his hand and turned him towards the South look this way first he said Frodo looked and saw still at some distance a hill of many mighty trees or a city of

          
          17:03:21
          Green Towers which it was he could not tell out of it it seemed to him that the Power and Light Came that held all the land and sway he longed suddenly to Fly Like a Bird to rest in the Green City then he looked Eastward and saw all the land of lauran running down to the pale gleam of andwin the Great River he lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out and he was back again in the world he knew beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty formless and vague until far away it rose again like a wall dark and

          
          17:04:01
          Breer the Sun that lay on lothan had no power to Enlighten the shadow of that distant height there lies the fastness of Southern merkwood said halier it is clad in a forest of dark fur where the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and Wither in the midst Upon A Stony height stands D gor where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling we fear that now it is inhabited again and with power Sevenfold a black cloud lies often over it of late in this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one

          
          17:04:42
          to another and ever they strive now in thought but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered not yet he turned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him at the hills foot Frodo found Aragon standing still and Silent as a tree but in his hand was a small golden Bloom of Eleanor and a light was in his eyes he was wrapped in some Fair memory and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place for the Grim years were

          
          17:05:21
          a mov moved from the face of Aragon and he seemed clothed in white a young Lord tall and fair and he spoke words in the Elish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see Arn Vana Namar he said and then he drew a breath and returning out of his thought he looked at rodo and smiled here is the heart of elom on Earth he said and here my heart dwells ever unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread you and I come with me and taking Frodo's hand in his he left the hill of kin Alro

          
          17:06:03
          and came there never again as living Man chapter 7 the mirror of Galadriel the sun was sinking behind the mountains and the Shadows were deepening in the woods when they went on again their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered night came beneath the trees as they walked and the elves uncovered their silver lamps suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening Sky pricked by a few early stars there was a wide treeless space before them running in a great circle

          
          17:06:46
          and bending away on either hand Beyond it was a deep Foss lost in soft Shadow but the grass upon its Brink was green as if it glowed still in memory of the Sun that had gone upon the furthest side there Rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with Malon trees taller than any they had yet seen in all the land their height could not be guessed but they stood up in the Twilight like living Towers in their many teared branches and amid their ever moving leaves countless

          
          17:07:22
          lights Were Gleaming green and gold and silver Haler turned towards the company welcome to caras gathon he said here is the city of the gatham where dwell the Lord Korn and gadriel the lady of lauan but we cannot enter here for the gates do not look northward we must go round to the southern side and the way is not short for the city is great there was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the Foss along this they went Westward with a city ever climbing up like a green Cloud

          
          17:08:03
          upon their left and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth until all the hills seemed a far with stars they came at last to a white bridge and Crossing found the great Gates of the city they faced Southwest set between the ends of the encircling wall that here overlapped and they were tall and strong and hung with many lamps halier knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but of gods Frodo could see no sign The Travelers passed within and the gate shut behind them they were in a

          
          17:08:42
          deep Lane between the ends of the wall and passing quickly through it they entered the city of the trees no folk could they see nor hear any feet upon the paths but there were many voices about them and in the air above far away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves they went along many paths and climbed many stairs until they came to the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering it was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs

          
          17:09:20
          of trees and it fell into a basin of silver from which a white stream spilled upon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bowl gleamed like gray silk and up it towered until its first branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves beside it a broad white ladder stood and at its foot three elves were seated they sprang up as The Travelers approached and Frodo saw that they were tall and clad in Gray male and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks here

          
          17:09:59
          dwell caborn and Galadriel said halier it is their wish that you should Ascend and speak with them one of the elf wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above I will go first said Haler let Frodo come next and with him Legolas The Others May follow as they wish it is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way as he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets some on one side some on another and some set about the bowl of the tree

          
          17:10:41
          so that the ladder passed through them at a great height above the ground he came to a wide Talon like the deck of a great ship on it was built a house so large that almost it would have served for a hall of men upon the Earth he entered behind Haler and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great malor now tapering towards its crown and yet making still a pillar of wide girth the chamber was filled with a soft light its walls were green and silver

          
          17:11:17
          and its roof of gold many elves were seated there on two chairs beneath the bowl of the tree and canopi by a living bow there sat side by side Korn and Galadriel they stood up to greet their guests after the manner of elves even those who were accounted Mighty Kings very tall they were and the lady no less tall than the Lord and they were grave and beautiful they were clad holy in White and the hair of the lady was of deep gold and the hair of the Lord calborn was of silver long and bright but no sign of age was upon them unless

          
          17:11:57
          it were in the depths of their eyes for these were Keen as lances in the Starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory halia LED Frodo before them and the Lord welcomed him in his own tongue the Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face sit now beside my chair thodo of the sh said kbon when all have come we will speak together each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered welcome Aragon son of Aron he said it is 8 and 30 years of the world outside since you came to this land and

          
          17:12:42
          those years lie heavy on you but the end is near for good or ill here lay aside your burden for a while well welcome son of thuel too seldom do my Kindred Journey hither from the north welcome gimly son of Glo it is long indeed since we saw one of Duran's folk in caralon but today we have broken our long law may it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand and that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples gimy bowed low when all the guest were seated before his chair the Lord looked at them

          
          17:13:25
          again here there are eight he said nine were to set out so said The Messengers but maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not heard El Rond is far away and darkness gathers between us and all this year the Shadows have grown longer nay there was no change of counsel said the Lady Galadriel speaking for the first time her voice was clear and musical but deeper than woman's won't Gandalf the gy set out with the company but he did not pass the borders of this land now tell us where he is for

          
          17:14:06
          I much desired to speak with him again but I cannot see him from afar unless he comes within the fences of lloran a gray mist is about him and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from me alas said Aragon Gandalf the Gray fell into Shadow he remained in Moria and did not Escape at these words all the elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement these are evil Tidings said kellor the most evil that have been spoken here in long years full of Grievous Deeds he turned to Haler why

          
          17:14:50
          has nothing of this been told to me before he asked in the Elven tongue we have not spoken to Haler of our Deeds or our purpose said Legolas at first we were weary and danger was too close behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time as we walked in gladness on the fair Paths of lauan yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said Frodo Gandalf was our guide and he led us through Moria and when our Escape seemed Beyond hope he saved us and he fell tell us now the full tale said

          
          17:15:30
          kelbor then Aragon recounted all that had happened upon the pass of kathas and in the days that followed and he spoke of barlin and his book and the fight in the chamber of mazul and the fire and the narrow bridge and the coming of the terror an evil of the ancient world it seemed such as I have never seen before said Aragon it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible it was a BAL Rog of morgoth said Legolas of all elf Banes the most deadly save the one who sits in the Dark Tower indeed I saw upon the bridge that

          
          17:16:13
          which haunts our darkest dreams I saw doran's Bane said gimy in a low voice and Dread was in his eyes alas said calborn we long have feared that under kathra a tera slipped but had I known that the dwarves had stirred up this evil in Moria again I would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders you and all that went with you and if it were possible one would say that at the last gandal fell from wisdom into Folly going needlessly into the net of Moria he would be rash indeed that said that thing said Galadriel Gravely

          
          17:16:54
          needless were none of the Deeds of Gandalf in life those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose but however it may be with a guide the followers of blameless do not repent of your welcome to the dwarf if our folk had been exiled long and far from looran who of the garim even kellor the wise would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient home though it had become an abode of dragons dark is the water of heled zaram and cold are the Springs of kibil Nala

          
          17:17:33
          and fair were the many pillared holes of Kazar Doom in Elder days before the fall of Mighty Kings beneath the stone she looked upon gibli who sat glowering and sad and she smiled and the dwarf hearing the names given in his own ancient young looked up and met her eyes and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly Into the Heart of an enemy and saw their love and understanding Wonder came into his face and then he smiled in answer he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashion saying yet more fair is

          
          17:18:11
          the living land of lauan and the lady gadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the Earth there was silence at length kbor spoke again I did not know that your plight was so evil he said let gimly forget my harsh words I spoke in the trouble of my heart I will do what I can to Aid you each according to His Wish and need but especially that one of the little folk who Bears the burden your quest is known to us said gadriel looking at Frodo but we will not hear speak of it more openly yet not in vain will it prove maybe that

          
          17:18:55
          you came to this land seeking Aid as Gandalf himself plainly purposed for the lord of the goatham is accounted the wisest of the elves of Middle Earth and The Giver of gifts beyond the power of Kings he has dwelt in the west since the days of Dawn and I have dwelt with him years uncounted for air the fall of nond or gondolin I passed over the mountains and to together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat I it was who first summoned the white Council and if my designs had not

          
          17:19:30
          gone a miss it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey and then mayap things would have gone otherwise but even now there is hope left I will not give you counsel saying do this or do that for not in doing or contriving nor in choosing between this course and another can I avail but only in knowing what was and is and in part also what shall be but this I will say to you your quest stands upon the edge of a knife stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all yet hope remains while all the company is

          
          17:20:10
          [Music] true and with that word she held them with her eyes and in silence look searchingly at each of them in turn none save Legolas and Aragon could long endure her glance Sam quickly blushed and hung his head at length the lady gadriel released them from her eyes and she smiled do not let your hearts be troubled she said tonight you shall sleep in peace then they sighed and felt suddenly weary as those who have been questioned long and deeply though no words had been spoken openly go now said kellor you were worn with

          
          17:20:55
          sorrow and much toil even if your quest did not concern us closely you should have refuge in this city until you are healed and refreshed now you shall rest and we will not speak of your further Road for a while that night the company slept upon the ground much to the satisfaction of the hobbits the elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain and in it they laid soft couches then speaking words of peace with Fair Elish voice as they left them for a little while The Travelers talked

          
          17:21:32
          of their night before in the Treetops and of their Day's Journey and of the Lord and Lady for they had not yet the heart to look further back what did you blush for Sam said Pippen you soon broke down anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience I hope it was nothing worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets I never thought No Such Thing answered Sam in no mood for Gest if you want to know I felt as if I hadn't gotten nothing on and I didn't like it she seemed to be looking inside me and

          
          17:22:09
          asking me what I would do if she gave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hobbit hole with with a bit of Garden of my own that's funny said Mary almost exactly what I felt myself only only well I don't think I'll say anymore he ended lamely all of them it seemed had fared alike each had felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead and something that he greatly desired clear before his mind it lay and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road and leave the quest

          
          17:22:50
          and the war against against siren to others and it seemed to me too said gimy that my choice would remain secret and known only to myself to me it seemed exceedingly strange said bmir maybe it was only a test and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose but almost I should have said that she was tempting us and offering what she pretended to have the power to give it need not said that I refused to listen the men of minth are true to their word but what he thought that the lady

          
          17:23:28
          had offered him Boromir did not tell and as for Frodo he wouldn't speak though Boromir pressed him with questions she held you long in her gaze ringbearer he said yes said Frodo but whatever came into my mind then I will keep there well have a care said I don't feel too sure of this Elvish lady and her purposes speak no evil of the lady gadriel said Aragon sternly you know not what you say there is in her and in this land no evil unless a man bring it hither himself then let him beware but tonight I shall sleep without fear for

          
          17:24:13
          the first time since I left render and may I sleep deep and forget for a while my grief I am weary in body and in heart he cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep the others soon did the same and no sound or dream Disturbed their Slumber when they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the lawn before the Pavilion and the fountain Rose and fell glittering in the sun they remained some days in lothan so far as they could tell or remember all the while that they dwelt there the

          
          17:24:53
          sun Shone clear safe for a gentle rain that fell at times and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean the air was cool and soft as if it were early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter it seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it was enough they hadn't seen the Lord and Lady again and they had little speech with the Elven folk for few of these knew or would use the Western tongue Hower had bidden them farewell

          
          17:25:30
          and gone back again to the fences of the north where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the company had brought Legolas was away much among the gatham and after the first night he did not sleep with the other companions though he returned to eat and talk with them often he took gimly with him when he went abroad in the land and the others wondered at this change now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of gandal and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their

          
          17:26:05
          minds as they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen often they heard nearby Elish voices singing and knew that they were making songs of lamentation for his fall for they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand myth rander myth rander sang the elves oh Pilgrim gray for so they loved to call him but if Legolas was with the company he would not interpret the songs for them saying that he had not the skill and that for him the grief was still too near a

          
          17:26:47
          matter for tears and not yet for song it was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme even in rivendel he had listened and had not sung himself though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before him but now as he sat beside the fountain in lauran and heard about him the voices of the elves his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to him yet when he Tri tried to repeat it to Sam only snatches remained faded as a

          
          17:27:24
          handful of withered leaves when evening in the show was gray his footsteps on the hill were heard before the dawn he went away on Journey long without a word from wilderland to western shore from northern wte to Southern Hill through Dragon Lair and hid and door and darkling Woods he walked at will with dwarf and harbit elves and men with mortal and Immortal folk with bird on bow and beast in Den in their own secret tongues he spoke a deadly sword a Healing Hand a back that bent beneath its load a trumpet voice a burning brand

          
          17:28:38
          a weary Pilgrim on the road a lord of wisdom throned he sat Swift in anger quick to laugh an old man in a battered hat who leaned upon a thorny stuff he stood upon the bridge alone and fire and Shadow both defied his stuff was broken on the stone in kazad Doom his wisdom died why you'll be beating Mr Bilbo next said Sam no I'm afraid not said Frodo but that's the best I can do yet well Mr Frodo if you do have another go I hope you'll say a word about his fireworks said Sam something like this the finest Rockets ever seen they

          
          17:29:49
          burst into stars of blue and green or after Thunder golden showers come falling like a rain of flowers though that doesn't do them Justice by a long road no I'll leave that to you Sam or perhaps to Bilbo but well I can't talk of it anymore I can't bear to think of bringing the news to him one evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool Twilight both of them felt Restless again on Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must

          
          17:30:32
          leave Loth laan what do you think of elves now Sam he said I asked you the same question once before it seemed a very long while ago but you have seen more of them since then I have indeed said Sam and I reckon there's elves elves they're all Elish enough but they're not all the same now these folk aren't Wanderers or homeless and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to belong here more even than Hobbits do in the Shire whether they've made the land or the lands made them it's hard to say if

          
          17:31:10
          you take my meaning it's wonderfully quiet here nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to if there's any magic about it's right down deep where I can't lay my hands on it in a manner of speaking you can see and feel it everywhere said Frodo well said Sam you can't see nobody working it no fireworks like poor gandal used to show I wonder we don't see nothing of the Lord and Lady in all these days I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things if she had a mind i' dearly love to see some Elf Magic Mr

          
          17:31:51
          Frodo I wouldn't said Frodo I'm content and I don't miss Gandalf's fireworks but his bushy eyebrows and his quick temper and his voice you're right said Sam and don't think I'm finding fault I've often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in the old Tales but I've never heard of a bit of land than this it's like being at home and on a holiday at the same time if you understand me I don't want to leave all the same I'm beginning to feel that if we've got to go on then we'd best get it

          
          17:32:30
          over it's that job that's never started as takes longest to finish as my old Yer used to say and I don't reckon that these folk can do much more to help us magic or no it's when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse I'm thinking I'm afraid that's only too true M said Frodo yet I hope very much that before we leave we shall see the lady of the elves again even as he spoke they saw as if she came in answer to their words the Lady Galadriel approaching tall and white and fair she walked beneath the

          
          17:33:08
          trees she spoke no word but beckoned to them turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of caras galon and pass passing through a high Green Hedge they came into an enclosed Garden no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky the evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the Western Woods down a long flight of steps the lady went into a deep green Hollow through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill at the bottom upon

          
          17:33:46
          a low pedestal carved like a branching tree stood a basin of silver wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver Ure with water from the stream Galadriel filled the Basin to the brim and breathed on it and when the water was still again she spoke here is the mirror of gadriel she said I have brought you here so that you may look in it if you will the air was very still and the Dell was dark and the elf lady beside him was tall and pale what shall we we look for and what shall we see asked Frodo filled with awe

          
          17:34:25
          many things I can command the mirror to reveal she answered and to some I can show what they desire to see but the miror will also show things unbidden and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold what he will see if you leave the mirror free to work I cannot tell for it CHS things that were and things that are and things that yet may be but which it is that he sees even the wisest cannot always tell do you wish to look Frodo didn't answer and you she said turning to Sam for this is what

          
          17:35:08
          your folk would call Magic I believe though I do not understand clearly what they mean and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the enemy but this if you will is the magic of gadriel did you not say that you wished to see Elf Magic I did said Sam trembling a little between fear and curiosity I'll have a peep lady if you're willing and I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home he said in an aside to Frodo it seems a terrible long time that I've been away but there like as not I'll only see the

          
          17:35:48
          stars or something that I won't understand like us not said the lady with a gentle laugh but come you shall look and see what you may do not touch the water Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the Basin the water looked hard and dark stars were reflected in it there's only stars as I thought he said then he gave a low gasp for the Stars went out and as if a dark Veil had been withdrawn the mirror grew gray and then clear there was sun shining and the branches of trees were waving and

          
          17:36:29
          tossing in the wind but before Sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw the light faded and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark Cliff then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage and climbing an endless Winding Stair it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something but what it was he did not know like a dream the vision shifted and went back and he saw the trees again but this time they were not so close and he could see what

          
          17:37:04
          was going on they were not waving in the wind they were falling crashing to the ground I cried Sam in an outraged voice there's that ted sand himman are cutting down trees as he shouldn't they didn't ought to be it's that Avenue Beyond The Mill that Shades the road to byw waterer I wish I could get a Ted and I'd fail him but now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished and a large red brick building was being put up where it had stood lots of folk were busily at work there was a tall red chimney nearby black smoke

          
          17:37:42
          seemed to Cloud the surface of the bidder there's some devilry at work in the Shire he said elron knew what he was about when he wanted to send Mr Mary back then suddenly Sam gave a cry and sprang away I can't stay here he said wildly I must go home they've dug up bagshot row and there's the poor old gaffer going down the hill with his bits of things on a barrow I must go home you cannot go home alone said the lady you did not wish to go home without your master before you looked in the mirror and yet you knew that evil things might

          
          17:38:19
          might well be happening in the sh remember that the mirror shows many things and not all have yet come to pass some never come to be unless those that behold the Visions turn aside from their path to prevent them the miror is dangerous as a guide of Deeds Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands I wish I'd never come here and I don't want to see no more magic he said and felt silent after a moment he spoke again thickly as if struggling with tears no I'll go home by the long road with Mr Frodo or not at

          
          17:38:59
          all he said but I hope I do get back someday if what I've seen turns out true somebody's going to catch it hot do you now wish to look Frodo said the lady gadriel you did not wish to see Elf Magic and were content do you advise me to look asked Frodo no she said I do not counsel you one way or the other I am not a counselor you may learn something and whether what you see be fair or evil that may be profitable and yet it may not seeing is both good and perilous yet I think Frodo that you have courage and wisdom enough

          
          17:39:41
          for the venture or I would not have brought you here do as you will I will look said Frodo and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water at once the M cleared and he saw a Twilight land mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale Sky a long gray Road wound back out of sight far away a figure came slowly down the road faint and small at first but growing larger and clearer as it approached suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf he almost called aloud the Wizard's name and then he saw that

          
          17:40:23
          the figure was clothed not in Gray but in White in a white that Shone faintly in the Dusk and in its hand there was a white staff the head was so bowed that he could see no face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the mirror's view doubt came into Frodo's mind was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely Journeys long ago or was was it Saran the vision now changed brief and small but very Vivid he caught a glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his

          
          17:40:59
          room the table was littered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows then there was a pause and after it many Swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved the Mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once the sea Darkness fell the sea Rose and raged in the great storm then he saw against the sun sinking blood red into a rack of clouds the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up

          
          17:41:36
          out of the west then a wide river flowing through a populous city then a white Fortress with seven Towes and then again a ship with Black Sails but now it was morning again and the water rippled with light and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree Shone in the Sun a smoke as a fire and battle arose and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a gray mist and into the Mist a small ship passed away twinkling with lights it vanished and Frodo side and prepared to draw away but suddenly the mirror went all

          
          17:42:13
          together dark as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight and Frodo looked into emptiness in the black abyss there appeared a single eye that slowly grew until it filled nearly all the mirror so terrible it was that Frodo stood rooted unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze the eye was rimmed with fire but was itself glazed yellow as a cat's watchful and intent and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing then the eye began to Rove searching this way way and that and

          
          17:42:50
          Frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one but he also knew that it could not see him not yet not unless he will it the ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy heavier than a great Stone and his head was dragged downwards the mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the water he was slipping forward do not touch the water said the Lady Galadriel softly the vision faded and Frodo found that he was looking at

          
          17:43:24
          the cool Stars twinkling in the silver Basin he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady I know what it was that you last saw she said for that is also in my mind do not be afraid but do not think that only by singing amid the trees nor even by the Slender arrows of Elven bows is this land of loran maintained and defended against its enemy I say to you Frodo that even as I speak to you I perceive the dark lord and know his mind or all of his mind that concerns The Elves and he gropes ever to see me and

          
          17:44:04
          my thought but still the door is closed she lifted up her white arms and spread out her hands towards the east in a gesture of rejection and denial aril the evening star most beloved of the elves Shone clear above so bright was it that the figure of the Elven lady cast a dim shadow on the ground its Rays glanced upon a ring about her finger it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a white stone in it twinkled as if the even Star had come down to rest upon her hand Frodo gazed at the ring with

          
          17:44:44
          awe for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood yes she said divining his thought it is not permitted to speak of it and elron could not do so but it cannot be hidden from the ring bearer and one who has seen the eye verily it is in the land of lauran upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the three remains this is Nya the Ring of adamant and I am its keeper he suspects but he does not know not yet do you not see now wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom for if you fail then we are laid

          
          17:45:26
          bare to the enemy yet if you succeed then our power is diminished and Loth laan will fade and the tides of Time Will sweep it away we must depart into the west or dwindle to a rustic folk of Dell and Cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten Frodo bent his head and what do you wish he said at last that what should be shall be she answered the love of the elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged yet they will cast all away

          
          17:46:10
          rather than submit to saon for they know him now for the fate of loran you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own task yet I could wish were it of any Avail that the one ring had never been wrought or had remained forever lost you are wise and fearless and Fair Lady Galadriel said fro I will give you the one ring if you ask for it it is too great a matter for me gadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh why is the lady gadriel maybe she said yet here she has met her match in courtesy gently are you revenged for my

          
          17:46:54
          testing of your heart at our first meeting you begin to see with a Keen Eye I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer for many long years I had pondered what I might do should the great Ring come into my hands and behold it was brought within my grasp the evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways where the s and himself stands or Falls would not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of his ring if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest and now at last it comes you will

          
          17:47:34
          give me the ring freely in place of the dark lord you will set up a queen and I shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible as the morning in the night Fair as the sea and the Sun and the snow upon the mountain Dreadful as the storm and the lightning stronger than the foundations of the earth All Shall love me and despair she lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark she stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond

          
          17:48:08
          measurement and beautiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful then she let her hand fall and the light faded and suddenly she laughed again and low she was shrunken a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad I pass the test she said I will diminish and go into the west and remain Galadriel they stood for a long while in silence at length the lady spoke again let us return she said in the morning you must depart for now we have Chosen and the tides of Fate are

          
          17:48:52
          flowing I would ask one thing before we go said Frodo a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in rivendel I'm permitted to wear the One Ring why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them you have not tried she said only Thrice have you set the ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed do not try it would destroy you did not gandal tell you that the Rings give power according to the measure of each possessor before you could use that power you would need to

          
          17:49:26
          become far stronger and to train your will to the domination of others yet even so as ringbearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden your sight has grown Keener you have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise you saw the eye of him that holds the seven and the nine and did you not see and recognize the ring upon my finger did you see my ring she asked turning again to Sam no lady he answered to tell you the truth I wondered what you were talking about I

          
          17:50:02
          saw a star through your finger but if you'll pardon my speaking out I think my master was right I wish you'd take his ring you'd put things to rights you'd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him a drift you'd make some folk pay for their dirty work I would she said that is how it would begin but it would not stop with that alas we will not speak more of it let us go chapter 8 farewell to lauan that night the company was again summoned to the Chamber of kelborn and there the Lord and Lady greeted them

          
          17:50:45
          with Fair words at length kbor spoke of their departure now is the time he said when those who wish to continue the quest must Harden their hearts to leave this land those who no longer wish to go forward May remain here for a while but whether they stay or go none can be short of Peace for we have come now to the edge of Doom here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open again or we summon them to the last need of laan then they may return to their

          
          17:51:21
          own lands or else go to the Long home of those that fall in battle there was silence they all resolved to go forward said gadriel looking in their eyes as for me said bmir my way home lies onward and not back that is true said calbor but is all this company going with you to minth we have not decided our course said Aragon Beyond Loth laan I do not know what Gandalf intended to do indeed I do not think that even he had any clear purpose maybe not said calborn yet when you leave this land you can no

          
          17:52:04
          longer forget the Great River as some of you know well it cannot be crossed by Travelers with baggage between laian and Gondor save by boat and are not the bridges of us gillath broken down and all the landings held now by the enemy on which side will you Journey the way to Min tith lies upon this side upon the west but the straight road of the quest lies east of the river upon the darker Shore which Shore will you now take if my advice is heeded it will be the western shore and the way to Min tith answered bmir but I am not the

          
          17:52:43
          leader of the company the other said nothing and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled I see that you do not yet know what to do said kellor it is not my part to choose for you but I will help you as I may there are some among you who can handle boats Legolas whose folk know the Swift Forest River and Boromir of Gondor and Aragon The Traveler and one Hobbit cried Mary not all of us look on boats as wild horses my people live by the banks of the Brandy Wine that is well said kellor then I will furnish your company with

          
          17:53:23
          boats they must be small and light for if you go far by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them you will come to the Rapids of SAR gabir and maybe at last to the Great Falls of raos Where the River Thunders down from n oil and there are other perils boats may make your journey less toysome for a while yet they will not give you counsel in the end you must leave them in the river and turn west or east Aragon thanked kellor many times the gift of boats comforted him much not

          
          17:54:00
          least because there would now be no need to decide his course for some days the others too looked more hopeful whatever perils lay ahead it seemed better to float down the broad tide of andwin to meet them than to plod forward with bent backs only Sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses or worse and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them all shall be prepared for you and await you at the Haven before noon tomorrow said kellor I will send my

          
          17:54:36
          people to you in the morning to help you make ready for the journey now we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep good night my friends said Galadriel sleep in peace do not trouble your hearts over much with thought of the road tonight maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet though you do not see them good night the company took their leave and returned to their Pavilion legalis went with them for this was to be their last night in llan and in spite of the words

          
          17:55:15
          of gadriel they wished to take counsel together for a long time they debated what they should do and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the ring but they came to no decision it was plain that most of them desired to go first to minth and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the enemy they would have been willing to follow a leader over the river and into the Shadow of Mordor but Frodo spoke no word and Aragon was still divided in his mind his own plan while gandaf remained

          
          17:55:51
          with him had been to go with Boromir and with his sword helped to deliver Gondor for he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons and that the hour had come at last when the heir of a lendel should come forth and strive with saurin for the Mastery but in Moria the burden of gandal had been laid on him and he knew that he could not now forsake the ring if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir and yet what help could he or any of the company give to Frodo save to walk blindly with him into

          
          17:56:27
          the darkness I shall go to Min tith alone if need be for it is my duty said Boromir and after that he was silent for a while sitting with his eyes fixed on Frodo as if he was trying to read the harling's thoughts at length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with himself self if you wish only to destroy the ring he said then there is little use in war and weapons and the men of minth cannot help but if you wish to destroy the armed might of the dark lord then it is folly to go without Force into his

          
          17:57:06
          domain and Folly to throw away he paused suddenly as if he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud it would be Folly to throw lives away I mean he ended it's a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death at least that is how I see it Frodo caught something new and strange in boromir's glance and he looked hard at him plainly boromir's thought was different from his final words it would be Folly to throw away what the ring of power he had said

          
          17:57:45
          something like this at the council but then he had accepted Ed the correction of Elon Frodo looked at Aragon but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromir's words and so their debate ended Mary and Pippen were already asleep and Sam was nodding the night was growing old in the morning as they were beginning to pack their slender Goods elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey the food was mostly in the form of very thin

          
          17:58:24
          cakes made of a meal that was baked to light brown on the outside and inside was the color of cream gimly took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye crem he said under his breath as he broke off a crisp corner and dibbled at it his expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish no more no more cried the elves laughing you have eaten enough already for a Long Day's March I thought it was only a kind of crem such as the Dale men make for Journeys in the wild said the dwarf so

          
          17:59:02
          it is they answered but we call it lambar or way bread and it is more strengthening than any food made by men and it is more pleasant than cram by all accounts indeed it is said gimy why it's better than the Honey Cakes of the beornings and that is great praise for the beornings are the best bakers that I know of but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to Travelers in these days you are kindly hosts all the same we bid you spare the food they said eat little at a time and only at need for these things are given

          
          17:59:40
          to serve you when all else fails the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if they are unbroken and left in the their Leaf rappings as we've brought them one will keep a traveler on his feet for a day of long labor even if he be one of the tall men of minth the elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the company the clothes they had brought for each they had provided a hood and a cloak made according to his size of the light but warm silken stuff that the gatham wo it was hard to say of what color they were gray with a the Hue

          
          18:00:18
          of Twilight under the trees they seemed to be and yet if they were moved or set in another light they were green as shadowed leaves or brown as fellow Fields By Night dusk silver as water under the stars each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver are these magic cloaks asked Pippen looking at them with wonder I do not know what to mean by that answered the leader of the elves they are fair garments and the web is good for it was made in this land they are

          
          18:00:56
          Elish robes certainly if that is what you mean leaf and Branch water and stone they have the Hue and beauty of all these things under the Twilight of lauan that we love for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make yet they are garments not armor and they will not turn Shaft or blade but they should serve you well they are light to wear and warm enough or cool enough at need and you will find them a great Aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes whether you walk among

          
          18:01:29
          the stones or the trees you are indeed high in the favor of the lady for she herself and her maidens wo this stuff and never before have we clad strangers in the Garb of our own people after their morning meal the company said farewell to the the lawn by the fountain their hearts were heavy thought it was a fair place and it had become like home to them though they could not count the days and nights that they had passed there as they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight Haler came walking towards

          
          18:02:06
          them over the Green Grass of the Glade Frodo greeted him with delight I have returned from the northern fences said the elf and I am sent now to be your guide again again the diil Dale is full of vapor and clouds of smoke and the mountains are troubled there are noises in the deeps of the earth if any of you had thought of returning northwards to your homes you would not have been able to pass that way but come your path now goes south as they walked through caras galon the Greenways were empty but in the

          
          18:02:43
          trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing they themselves went silently at last Haler LED them down the Southward slopes of the hills and they came again to The Great Gate hung with lamps and to the White Bridge and so they passed out and left the city of the elves then they turned away from the paved Road and took a path that went off into a deep Thicket of Malon trees and passed on winding through rolling Woodlands of Silver Shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwards

          
          18:03:21
          towards the shores of the river they had gone some 10 miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded with golden Elanor that glinted in the Sun the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins on the right and West the silverload flowed glittering on the left and East the Great River rolled its broad Waters deep and dark on the further Shores The Woodlands still

          
          18:04:00
          marched on southwards as far as the eye could see but all the banks were Bleak and bare no malor lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the land of lauran on the bank of the Silver Load at some distance up from the meeting of the streams there was a hi of white stones and white wood by it were mored many boats and barges some were brightly painted and sha with silver and gold and green but most were either white or gray three small gray boats had been made ready for The Travelers and in these the elves stowed their goods and they added

          
          18:04:40
          also coils of rope three to each boat slender they looked but strong silken to the touch gray of hue like the Elvin cloaks what are these asked Sam handling one that lay upon the green sword ropes indeed answered an elf from the boats never travel far without a rope and one that is long and strong and light such are these they may be a help in many needs you don't need to tell me that said Sam I came without any and I've been worried ever since but I was wondering what these were made of knowing a bit about rope making it's

          
          18:05:23
          in the family as you might say they are made of Hine said the elf but there is no time now to instruct you in the art of their making had we known that this craft delighted you we could have taught you much but now alas unless you should at some time hither turn you must be content with our gift may it serve you well come said Haler all is now ready for you enter the boats but take care at first heed the words said the other elves these boats are light built and they are crafty and unlike the boats of

          
          18:06:02
          other folk they will not sink laid them as you will but they are Wayward if mishandled it would be wise if you accustom yourselves to stepping in and out here where there is a landing place before you set off Downstream the company was arranged in this way Aragon Frodo and Sam were in one boat Boromir Mery and Pippin in another and in the third were Legolas and gimy who had now become fast friends in this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed the boats were moved and steered with short-handled paddles that had Broad

          
          18:06:41
          Leaf shaped blades when all was ready Aragon LED them on a trial up the silverload the current was Swift and they went forward slowly Sam sat in the boughs clutching the sides and looking back wistfully to the shore the sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes as they passed Beyond The Green Field of the tongue the trees Drew down to the river's bank here and there Golden Leaves tossed and floated on the Rippling stream the air was very bright and still and there was a silence except for the high distant song of

          
          18:07:19
          locks they turned a sharp Bend in the river and there sailing proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of great size the water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck its beak Shone like burnished gold and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow Stones its huge white wings were half lifted a music came down the river as it drew nearer and suddenly they perceived D that it was a ship rought and carved with Elven skill in the likeness of a bird two elves clad in

          
          18:07:55
          white steered it with black paddles in the midst of the vessel sat calborn and behind him stood Galadriel tall and white a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair and in her hand she held a harp and she sang sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air I sang of leaves of leaves of gold and leaves of gold there grew of wind I sang a wind there came and in the branches blew beyond the sun beyond the moon the foam was on the sea and by the strand of Marin there through a golden

          wide SE and G stayed his boat as the swans ship Drew alongside the lady ended her song and greeted them we have come to bid you our last farewell she said and to speed you with blessings from our land though you have been our guests said calborn you have not yet eaten with us and we bid you therefore to a parting Feast here between the flowing Waters that will bear you far from lauran the swan passed on slowly to the hie and they turned their boats and followed it there in the last end of egil upon the green grass The Parting

          
          18:10:56
          Feast was held but Frodo ate and drank little heeding only the beauty of the lady and her voice she seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled with hidden power already she seemed to him as by men of later days elves still the times are seen present and yet remote a living vision of that which is already been left Far Behind by the flowing streams of time after they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass kelborn spoke to them again of their journey and lifting his hand he pointed South to the woods

          
          18:11:35
          beyond the tongue as you go down the water he said you will find that the trees will fail and you will come to a Barren country there the River Flows in stone Veil amid High Moors until at last after many leagues it comes to the Tall Island of the tind Rock and that we call tall brander there it casts its arms about the Steep shores of the aisle and Falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of Ros down into the nalf the wetwang as it is called in your tongue that is a wide region of sluggish

          
          18:12:14
          Fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much bided there the endash Flows In by many mths from The Forest of fangor in the west about that stream on this side of the Great River lies Rohan on the further side of the Bleak Hills of the Emin mu the wind blows from the East there for they look out over the dead marshes and the no man lands to kth gorgor and the black Gates of Mordor Boromir and any that go with him seeking minth will do well to leave the Great River above Ros and cross the endash

          
          18:12:52
          before it finds the marshes yet they should not go too far up that stream no risk of becoming unentangled in the forest of fangor that is a Strange Land and is now little known but Boromir and Aragon doubtless do not need this warning indeed we have heard of fangor in Min tith said bmir but what I have heard seems to me for the most part oh wives tales such as we tell to our children all that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there of old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm but it is

          
          18:13:32
          now many lives of men since any of us visited it to prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years I have myself been at Wilds in Rowan but I have never crossed it northwards when I was sent out as a messenger I passed through the Gap by the skirts of the White Mountains and crossed the I and the gry flood into Norland a long and wearisome journey 400 leagues I reckoned it and it took me many months for I lost my horse at Thad at the foring of the gry flood after that journey and the road I have trotten

          
          18:14:09
          with this company I do not much doubt that I shall find a way through Rohan and fun G to if need be then I need say no more said kelborn but do not despise the law that has come down from distant years for of it may chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know now Galadriel Rose from the grass and taking a cup from one of her maidens she filled it with white Mead and gave it to kelborn now it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said drink lord of the gatham and let not your

          
          18:14:50
          heart be sad though night must follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh then she brought the cup to each of the company and B them drink and farewell but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass and chairs were set for her and for kellor her maiden stood silent about her and a while she looked upon her guests at last she spoke again we have drunk the cup of parting she said and the Shadows Fall between us but before you go I have brought in my ship gifts which the Lord and Lady of the

          
          18:15:29
          goatham now offer you in memory of lothlorian then she called to each in turn here is the gift of kelborn and Galadriel to the leader of your company she said to Aragorn and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword it was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves rought of silver and gold and on it were set in Elven rooms formed of many gems the name anduril and the lineage of the sword the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat she said but is there

          
          18:16:06
          ought else that you desire of me at our parting for Darkness will flow between us and it may be that we shall not meet again unless it be far hence Upon A Road that has no returning and Aragon answered lady you know of all my desire and long held in keeping the only treasure that I seek yet it is not yours to give me even if you would and only through Darkness shall I come to it yet maybe this will lighten your heart said garriel for it was left in my care to be given to you should you pass through this land then she lifted from

          
          18:16:47
          her lap a great Stone of a clear green set in a silver brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle withouts spread wings and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of spring this Stone I gave to Calon my daughter and she to hers and now it comes to you as a token of Hope in this hour take the name that was foretold for you elesa the elf Stone of the house of bendil then Aragon took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast and those who saw him wondered for they had

          
          18:17:26
          not marked before how tall and kingly he stood and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen from his shoulders for the gifts that you have given me I thank you he said Oh Lady of lauan of whom was sprung Calon and aen Heathen star what praise could I say more the lady bowed her head and she turned then to Boromir and to him she gave a belt of gold and to Med and Pippen she gave small silver belts each with a clasp rought like a Golden Flower to Legolas she gave a bow such as the gatham used longer and stouter than the

          
          18:18:07
          bows of merkwood and strung with a string of Elf hair with it went a quiver of arrows for you Little Gardener and lover of trees she said to Sam I have only a small gift she put into his hand a little box of plain gray wood unadorned save for a single silver Rune upon the lid here is set G for gadriel she said but also it may stand for Garden in your tongue in this box there is Earth from my Orchard and such blessing as gadriel has still to bestow is upon it it will not keep you on your road will defend

          
          18:18:47
          you against any Peril but if you keep it and see your home again at last then perhaps it may reward you though you should find all Barren and laid waste There Will Be Few Gardens in Middle Earth that will Bloom like your garden If you sprinkle this Earth there then you may remember gadriel and catch a glimpse far off of lauan that you have seen only in our winter for our spring and our summer are gone by and they will will never be seen on Earth again save in memory Sam went red to the ears and

          
          18:19:24
          muttered something inaudible as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could and what gift would a dwarf Ask Of The Elves said Galadriel turning to gimy none lady answered gimy it is enough for me to have seen the lady of the gatham and to have heard her gentle words here all ye elves she cried to those about her let none say again that dwarves are grasping and ungracious yet surely kimly son of Glo you desire something that I could give name it I bid you you shall not be the only guest without a

          
          18:20:05
          gift there is nothing lady gadriel said gimy bowing low and stammering nothing unless it might be unless it is permitted to ask to name a single strand of your hair which surpasses the gold of the earth as the Stars surpass the gems of the mine I do not ask for such a gift but you commanded me to name my desire the elves stirred and murmured with astonishment and kellor gazed at the dwarf in Wonder but the lady smiled it is said that the skill of the dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues she said yet that is not

          
          18:20:47
          true of gimy for none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous and how shall I refuse since I commanded him to speak but tell me what would you do with such a gift treasure it lady he answered in memory of your words to me at our first meeting and If Ever I return to the smithies of my home it shall be set in imperishable Crystal to be an heirloom of my house and a pledge of Good Will between the mountain and the wood until the end of days then the lady unbreaded one of her long Tresses and cut off three golden

          
          18:21:28
          hairs and laid them in gim's hand these words shall go with the gift she said I do not forell for all foretelling is now vain on the one hand lies Darkness on the other only hope but if hope should not fail then I say to you gimly son of gloin that your hands shall flow with gold and yet over you gold Shall Have No Dominion and you ringbearer she said turning to Frodo I come to you last who are not last in my thoughts for you I have prepared this she held up a small Crystal file it glittered as she moved

          
          18:22:09
          it and Rays of white light sprang from her hand in this file she said is caught the light of arendel star set amid the Waters of my Fountain it will shine brighter when night is about you may it be a light to you in Dark Places when all other lights go out remember gadriel and her mirror Frodo took the file and for a moment as it Shone between them he saw her again standing like a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible he bowed but found no words to say now the lady arose and calborn led them

          
          18:22:52
          back to the hive a yellow noon lay on the green land of the tongue and the water glittered with silver all at last was made ready The company took their places in the boats as before crying farewell the elves of lauran with long gray poles thrust them out into the flowing stream and the Rippling Waters bore them slowly away The Travelers sat still without moving or speaking on the Green Bank near to the very point of the tongue the Lady Galadriel stood alone and Silent as they passed her they turned and their eyes

          
          18:23:27
          watched her slowly floating away from them for so it seemed to them loran was slipping backward like a bright ship mastered with Enchanted trees sailing on to forgotten Shores while they sat helpless upon the margin of the gray and leafless World e even as they gazed the Silver Load passed out into the currents of the Great River and their boats turned and began to speed Southward soon the white form of the lady was small and distant she Shone like a window of glass Upon A far Hill in the westering Sun or as a remote Lake

          
          18:24:05
          seen from a mountain a crystal fallen in the lap of the land then it seemed to Frodo that she lifted her arms in a final farewell and far but piercing clear on on the following wind came the sound of her voice singing for now she sang in the ancient tongue of the elves Beyond the Sea and he did not understand the words fair was the music but it did not comfort him yet as is the way of Elish words they remained Graven in his memory and long afterwards he interpreted them as well as he could the language was that of Elven song and

          
          18:24:43
          spoke of things little known on Middle Earth I [Music] El [Music] Mario mar elent [Music] Romo van Valar Val [Music] ah like gold fall the leaves in the wind long years as numberless as the wings of trees the long years have passed like Swift drafts of the sweet Mead in lofty Halls beyond the West beneath the blue vaults of varder wherein the Stars tremble in the song of her voice holy and queenly who now shall refill the cup for me for now the Kindler varder the queen of the stars from Mount everwhite has

          
          18:26:50
          uplifted her hands like clouds and all paths are drowned deep in Shadow and out of a gray country Darkness lies on the foaming waves between us and Mist covers the jewels of kakira forever now lost lost to those from the East is valimar farewell maybe Thou shalt find valimar maybe even Thou shalt find it farewell varda is the name of that lady whom the elves in these lands of Exile name elberth suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks rose upon either side and the light of lauan was hidden to

          
          18:27:36
          that fair land Frodo never came Again The Travelers now turned their faces to the journey the sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for all were filled with tears gimler wept openly I have looked to the last upon that which was fairest he said to legalis His companion henceforward I will call nothing Fair unless it be her gift he put his hand to his breast tell me legus why did I come on this Quest little did I know where the chief per truly Elon spoke saying that we could not foresee what we might meet

          
          18:28:17
          Upon Our Road torment in the dark was the danger that I feared and it did not hold me back but I would not have come had I known the danger of light and joy now I have taken my worst wound in this parting even if I were to go this night straight to the dark lord alas for gimly Son of Glo nay said Legolas alas for us all and for all that walk the world in these after days for such is the way of it to find and lose as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream but I count you blessed gimly son of gloin for

          
          18:28:58
          your loss you suffer of your own free will and you might have chosen otherwise but you have not forsaken your companions and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of lothan shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart and shall neither fade nor grow stale maybe said gimy and I thank you for your words true words doubtless yet all such Comfort is cold memory is not what the heart desires that is only a miror be it clear as heled zarum or so says the heart of gimy the dwarf elves may see

          
          18:29:38
          things otherwise indeed I have heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream not so for dwarves but let us talk no more of it look to the boat she is too low in the water with all this baggage and the Great River is Swift I do not wish to drown my grief in cold water he took up a paddle and steered towards the Western Bank following Aragon's boat ahead which had already moved out of the middle Stream So the company went on their long way down the wide hurrying Waters born

          
          18:30:15
          ever southwards bare wood stalked along either bank and they could not see any glimpse of the lands behind the breeze died away and the river flowed without a sound no voice of bird broke the silence the sun grew Misty as the day grew old until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl then it faded into the west and dusk came early followed by a gray and starless night far into the dark quiet hours they floated on Guiding their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western Woods great trees

          
          18:30:53
          passed by like ghosts thrusting their Twisted thirsty Roots through the Mist down into the water it was dreary and cold Frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the river fretting among the tree roots and Driftwood near the shore until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep chapter nine the Great River thodo was roused by Sam he found that he was lying well wrapped under tall gray skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the West Bank of the Great River andwin he had slept the night away and

          
          18:31:40
          the gray of morning was dim among the bare branches gimy was busy with a small far near at hand land they started again before the day was broad not that most of the company were eager to hurry southwards they were content that the decision which they must make at latest when they came to raos and The tnd Rock Isle still lay some days ahead and they let the river bear them on at its own pace having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay Beyond whichever course they took in the end Aragorn let them drift with the

          
          18:32:15
          stream as they wish husbanding their strength against weird to come but he insisted that at the least they should start early each day and journey on far into the evening for he felt in his heart that time was pressing and he feared that the dark lord had not been idle while they lingered in lauran nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next the dull gray hours passed without event as the third day of their Voyage wore on the lands changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether

          
          18:32:52
          on the Eastern Bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching Up and Away Towards the Sky Brown and withered they looked as if fire had passed over them leaving no living blade of green an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold Stone to relieve the emptiness they had come to the brown lands that lay V vast and desolate between Southern merkwood and the hills of the EM mu what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragon could not

          
          18:33:30
          tell upon the West to their right the land was treeless also but it was flat and in many places green with wide Plains of grass on this side of the river they passed forests of great Reeds so tall that they shut out all view to the West as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs hissing softly and sadly here and there through openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling mes and far beyond them Hills in the sunset and away

          
          18:34:08
          on the edge of sight a dark line where marched the southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains the there was no sign of living moving things save birds of these there were many small foul whistling and piping in the reads but they were seldom seen once or twice The Travelers heard the rush and whine of swan wings and looking up they saw a great felen streaming along the sky swans said Sam and mighty big ones too yes said Aragon and they are black SW swans how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks said Frodo I

          
          18:34:50
          always imagined that as one journeyed South it got warmer and merrier until winter was left behind forever but we have not journeyed far south yet answered Aragorn it is still winter and we are far from the sea here the world is cold until the sudden spring and we may yet have snow again far away down in the Bay of belfalas to which andwin runs it is warm and Mery maybe or would be but for the enemy but here we are not above 60 leagues I guess south of the South Farthing away in your Shire hundreds of long miles Yonder you

          
          18:35:29
          are looking now Southwest across the North Plains of the riddermark Rohan the land of the hor Lords a long we shall come to the mouth of the liml that runs down from Fon to join the Great River that is the North Boundary of Rohan and of old all that lay between Limelight and the White Mountains belonged to the rohim it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass has no rival but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the river or ride off to its Shores and when is wide yet the Orcs and shoot their arrows far

          
          18:36:04
          across the stream and of late it is said they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily the trees had seemed hostile before as if they harbored secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the trees were still there he felt that the company was too naked a float in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands and on a river that was the frontier of war in the next day or two as they went on borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity

          
          18:36:40
          grew on all the company for a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward the bank slid by soon the river broadened and grew more shallow long Stony beaches lay upon the East and there were gravel shs in the water so that careful steering was needed the brown lands Rose into Bleak walls over which flowed a chill air from the east on the other side the mees had become rolling Downs of withered grass amidst the land of finen and Tusk thodo shivered thinking of The Lawns and fountains the clear sun and the gentle

          
          18:37:17
          Reigns of loran there was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats each member of the company was busy with his own thoughts the heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some Northern Glade amid the beachwoods gimle was fingering gold in his mind and wondering if it were fit to be rought into the housing of the lady's gift Mary and Pippen in the middle boat were ill at ease for Bor sat muttering to himself sometimes biting his nails as if some restlessness or doubt consumed

          
          18:37:53
          him sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn's then Pippen who sat in the bow looked back caught a queer gleam in his eye as he peered forward gazing at Frodo Sam had long ago made up his mind that though Boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined he was cramped and miserable having nothing to do but stare at The winterlands Crawling by and the gray water on either side of him even

          
          18:38:28
          when the paddles were any use they did not trust Sam with them as dusk Drew on on the fourth day he was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of Earth under his toes suddenly something caught his sight at first he stared at it listlessly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes but when he looked again he could not see it anymore that night they camped on a small a close to the Western Bank Sam lay rolled in blankets beside

          
          18:39:07
          Frodo I had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped Mr Frodo he said or maybe it wasn't a dream funny it was was anyway well what was it said Frodo knowing that Sam would not settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was I haven't seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left loron it wasn't funny that way Mr Frodo it was queer all wrong if it wasn't a dream and you would best hear it it was like this I saw a log with eyes the logs all right said Frodo there are many in the river but leave

          
          18:39:48
          out the eyes that I won't said Sam was the eyes has made me sit up so to speak I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the Half Light Behind gim's boat but I didn't give much heed to it then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up and that was peculiar as you might say seeing as we were all floating on the stream together just then I saw the eyes two pale sort of points shiny like on a hump at the near end of the log what's more it wasn't a log for it had paddle feet like a swans

          
          18:40:27
          almost only they seemed bigger and kept dipping in and out of the water that's when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes meaning to give a shout if it was still there when I had rubbed the drows out of my head for the whatever it was was coming along fast now and getting close behind gimy but whether those two lamps spotted me moving and stared or whether I came to my senses I don't know when I looked again it wasn't there yet I think I caught a glimpse with a tail of my eye as the saying is of something dark

          
          18:41:03
          shooting under the shadow of the bank I couldn't see no more eyes though I said to myself dreaming Again Sam gamji I said and I said no more just then but I've been thinking since and now I'm not so sure what do you make of it Mr Frodo I should make nothing of it but a log and the Dusk and sleep in your eyes Sam said Frodo if this was the first time that those eyes had been seen but it isn't I saw them a away back North before we reached laurian and I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to

          
          18:41:40
          the flet that night halia saw it too and do you remember the report of the elves that went after the orc band ah said Sam I do and I remember more too I don't like my thoughts but thinking of one thing and another and Mr Bilbo's stories and all I fancy I could put a name on the creature at a guess a nasty name Gollum maybe yes that's what I feared for some time said Frodo ever since the night on the flet I suppose he was lurking in Moria and picked up our Trail then but I hop that our stay in laan

          
          18:42:19
          would throw him off the scent again the miserable creature must have been hiding in the Woods by the silverload watching a start off that's about it said Sam and we'd better be a bit more watchful ourselves or we'll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights if we ever wake up to feel anything and that's what I was leading up to no need to trouble Strider or the others tonight I'll keep watch I can sleep tomorrow being no more than Luggage in a boat as you might say I might said Frodo and I might say luggage

          
          18:42:56
          with eyes you shall watch but only if you promise to Wake Me Halfway towards morning if nothing happens before then in the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam shaking him it's a shame to wake you whispered Sam but that's what you said there's nothing to tell or not much I thought I heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise a while back but do you hear a lot of such queer Sounds by a river at night he laid down and Frodo sat up huddled in his blankets and fought off his

          
          18:43:32
          sleep minutes or hours passed slowly and nothing happened Frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape hardly visible floated close to one of the moed boats a long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunel two pale lamp likee eyes sha coldly as they peered inside and then they lifted and gazed up at Frodo on the aat they were not more than a yard or two away and Frodo heard the soft hiss of in Taken breath he stood up drawing Sting from

          
          18:44:08
          its sheath and faced the eyes immediately their light was shut off there was another hiss and a Splash and the dark log shape shot away Downstream into the night Aragon stirred in his sleep turned over and set up what is it he whispered springing up and coming to Frodo I felt something in my sleep why have you drawn your sword Gollum answered Frodo or at least so I guess ah said Aragorn so you know about our little footpad do you he pattered after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel since we took to boats

          
          18:44:50
          he's been lying on a log and peddling with hands and feet I've tried to catch him once or twice at night but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as a fish I hope the river Voyage would beat him but he's too clever a waterman we shall have to try going faster tomorrow you lie down now and I'll keep watch for what is left of the night I wish I could lay my hands on the wretch we might make him useful but if I can't we shall have to try and lose him he's very dangerous quite aart from Murder By Night on his

          
          18:45:25
          own account he may put any enemy that is about on our track the night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again after that the company kept a sharp Lookout but they saw no more of Gollum while the voyage lasted if he was still following he was very wary and cunning and Aragon's bidding they paddled now for long spells and the banks went swiftly by but they saw little of the country for they journeyed mostly by night and Twilight resting by day and lying as hidden as the land allowed in this way

          
          18:46:01
          the time passed without event until the seventh day the weather was still gray and overcast with wind from the East but as evening Drew into night the sky away Westward cleared and P of faint light yellow and pale green opened under the gray shores of cloud there the white rind of the new moon could be seen glimmering in the remote Lakes Sam looked at it and Puck at his brows the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly the banks began to rise and grow Stony soon they were passing through a hilly Rocky land

          
          18:46:40
          and on both Shores there were steep slopes bed in deep breaks of thorn and slow Tangled with brambles and creepers behind them stood low crumbling Cliffs and chimneys of gray weathered Stone dark with Ivy and Beyond these again there Rose higher ridges crowned with wind ryn Furs they were Drawing Near to the Grey Hill Country of the EM wheel the southern March of wilderland there were many birds about the cliffs and The Rock chimneys and all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling black against the pale sky

          
          18:47:18
          as they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights doubtfully wondering if golum had been doing some mischief and the news of their Voyage was now moving in the wilderness later as the sun was setting and the company was stirring and getting ready to start again he descried a dark spot against the fading light a great Bird high and far off now Wheeling now flying on slowly southwards what is that legus he asked pointing to the northern sky is it as I think an eagle yes said legus it is an eagle a

          
          18:47:56
          hunting Eagle I wonder what that for boess it is far from the mountains we will not start until it is fully dark said Aragorn the eighth night of their Journey came it was silent and windless the gray East Wind had passed away the thin Crescent of the Moon had fallen early into the pale Sunset but the sky was cleared above and though far away in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still Shone faintly in the west Stars glinted bright come said Aragon we will venture one more journey by night we are coming

          
          18:48:35
          to reaches of the river that I do not know well for I have never journeyed by water in these parts before not between here and the Rapids of s but if I am right in my Reckoning those are still many miles ahead still there are dangerous places even before we come there rocks and Stony aots in the Stream we must keep a sharp watch and not try to Peddle swiftly to Sam in the leading boat was given the task of Watchman he lay forward peering into the Gloom the night grew dark but the stars above were

          
          18:49:12
          strangely bright and there was a glimmer on the face of the River it was close on midnight and they had been drifting for some while hardly using the paddles when suddenly Sam cried out only a few yards ahead Dark shapes loomed up in the Stream and he heard the swirl of racing water there was a swift current which swung LIF towards the Eastern Shore where the channel was clear as they were swept aside The Travelers could see now very close the pale foam of the river lashing against sharp rocks that were

          
          18:49:44
          Thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth the boats were all huddled together ho there Aragon shouted barir as his boat bumped into the leader this is madness we cannot dare the Rapids by night but no boat can live in s Gib be it night or day back back cried Aragon turn turn if you can he drove his paddle into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round I am out of my Reckoning he said to Frodo I didn't know that we had come so far anduin flows faster than I thought son gber must be close at hand

          
          18:50:24
          already with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them about but at first they could make only small Headway against the current and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the Eastern Bank now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night all together paddle shouted bmir paddle or we shall be driven on the shs even as he spoke Frodo felt the Keel beneath him great upon stone at that moment there was a twang of bow strings several arrows whistled over them and some fell among them one

          
          18:51:01
          smot froo between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry Letting Go his paddle but the arrow fell back foiled by his hidden coat of mail another passed through Aragon's hood and a third stood fast in the gunel of the the second boat close by Med's hand Sam thought he could Glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shingle banks that lay under the Eastern Shore they seemed very near said Legolas falling into his own tongue Orcs cried gibli gollum's doing I'll be bound said Sam to Frodo and a nice place to choose

          
          18:51:39
          too the river seems set on taking us right into their arms they all leaned forward straining at the paddles even Sam took a hand every moment they expected to feel the bite of black feathered arrows many wind overhead or struck the water nearby but there were no more hits it was dark but not too dark for the Night Eyes Of Orcs And in the star glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some Mark unless it was that the gray cloaks of lauran and the gray Timber of the elfroot boats defeated the malice of the archers of

          
          18:52:13
          Mordor Stroke by stroke they labored on in the darkness it was hard to be sure that they were indeed moving at all but slowly the swirl of the water grew less and the shadow of the Eastern Bank faded back into the night at last as far as they could judge they had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting Rocks then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore under the shadow of of bushes leaning out over

          
          18:52:46
          the water they halted and Drew breath Legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from lauan then he sprang ashore and climbed a few Paces up the bank stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned peering back over the river into the darkness across the water there were shrill cries but nothing could be seen Frodo looked up at the elf Standing Tall above him as he gazed into the night seeking a mark to shoot at his head was dark crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools

          
          18:53:23
          of the sky behind but now rising and sailing up from the south the great clouds Advanced sending out dark outriders into the starry Fields a sudden dread fell on the company elberth Gil thel sighed Legolas as he looked up even as he did so a dark shape like a cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far more swiftly came out of the blackness in the South and sped towards the company blotting out all light as it approached soon it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than the pits in the night Fierce voices rose

          
          18:54:03
          up to greet it from across the water Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart there was a deadly cold like the memory of an old wound in his shoulder shoulder he crouched down as if to hide suddenly the great bow of lauan sang shrill went the arrow from the Elven string Frodo looked up almost above him the winged shape swerved there was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out of the air Vanishing down into the Gloom of the Eastern Shore the sky was clean again there was a tumult of many

          
          18:54:39
          voices far away cursing and wailing in the darkness and then silence neither shaft nor Cry came again from the East that night after a while Aragorn led the boats back Upstream they felt their way along the water's edge for some distance until they found a small shallow bay a few low trees grew there close to the water and behind them Rose a steep Rocky bank here the company decided to stay and awake the dawn it was useless to attempt to move further by night they made no camp and lit no fire but lay

          
          18:55:17
          huddled in the boats moed close together praised be the bow of galadrial and the hand and eye of Legolas said gim as he munched a wafer of lambas that was a mighty shot in the dark my friend but who can say what it hit said legalis I cannot said gimy but I'm glad that the shadow came no nearer I liked it not at all too much reminded me of the shadow in Moria the shadow of the bog he ended in a whisper it was not a bog said Frodo still shivering with the chill that had come upon him it was something colder I think it was then he

          
          18:56:00
          paused and fell silent what do you think asked Boromir eagerly leaning from his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo's face I think no I will not say answered Frodo what whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemies so it seems said Aragorn yet where they are and how many and what they will do next we do not know this night we must all be Sleepless dark hides us now but what the day will show who can tell have your weapons close to hand Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his

          
          18:56:40
          fingers and looking up at the sky it's very strange he murmured the moon's the same in the Shire and in wilderland or it ought to be but either it's out of it's running or I'm all wrong in my Reckoning you'll remember Mr Frodo the moon was waning As We Lay on the flet up in that tree a week from the fall I reckon and we've been a week on the way last night when up Pops a new moon as thin as a nail pairing as if we'd never stayed no time in the Elish country well I can remember three nights there

          
          18:57:17
          for certain and I seem to remember several more but I would take my oath it was never a whole month anyone would think that time didn't count in there and perhaps that was the way of it said Frodo in that land maybe we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by it was not I think until Sil Lo bore us back to andwin that we returned to the time that flows through mortal lands to the Great sea and I don't remember any Moon either New or Old in caras gathon only Stars by night and Sun by day legalo stirred in his boat nay time does

          
          18:57:58
          not t ever he said but change and growth is not in all things and places alike for the elves the world moves and it moves both very swiftly and very slow Swift because they themselves change little and all El sweets by it is a grief to them slow because they do not count the running years not for themselves the passing seasons of it ripples ever repeated in the long long stream yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last but the wearing is slow in lauan said Frodo the power of the lady is on

          
          18:58:38
          it rich of the hours though short they seem in caras gathon where galad wields the Elven ring that should not have been said outside lauan not even to me said Aragon speak no more of it but so it is Sam in that land you lost your count there time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves the old Moon passed and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside while we Ted there and yester Eve a new moon came again winter is nearly gone time flows on to a spring of little hope the night passed silently no voice

          
          18:59:21
          or call Was Heard again across the water The Travelers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather the air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the south and the distant Seas the rushing of the river over the rocks of the Rapids seemed to grow louder and closer the Twigs of the trees above them began to drip when the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad slowly the dawn grew to a paale light diffused and shadowless there was Mist on the river

          
          18:59:57
          and white fog SED the shore the far Bank could not be seen I can't abide fog said Sam but this seems to be a lucky one now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us perhaps said Aragon but it will be hard to find the PATH unless the fog lifts a little later on and we must find the PATH if we're to pass San gber and come to the EM wheel I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the river any further said bmir if the EM wheel lies before us then we can strike Westward

          
          19:00:37
          and Southward until we come to the end wash and cross into my own land we can if we are making for Min tith said Aragon but that is not yet agreed and such a course may be more perilous than it sounds the veil of endash is flat and fenny and fog is a deadly Peril there for those on foot and Laden I would not abandon our boats until we must the river is at least a path that cannot be missed but the enemy holds the Eastern Bank objected Boromir and even if you pass the gates of argonath and come unmolested to the tend rocks what will

          
          19:01:18
          you do then leap down the folds and land in the marshes no answered Aragorn say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to Rao's foot and there take to the water again do you not know Boromir or do you choose to forget the north stair and the high seat from arm on hand that were made in the days of the great Kings I at least have a mind to stand in that high place again before I decide my further course there maybe we shall see some sign that will guide us bomir held out long against this

          
          19:01:56
          choice but when it became plain that froda would follow Aragon wherever he went he gave in it is not the way of the men of minth to Desert their friends at need he said and you will need my strength if ever you are to reach the tind rock to the tall aisle I will go but no further there I shall turn to my home alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship the day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little it was decided that Aragorn and legalis should at once go forward along the shores

          
          19:02:35
          while the others remained by the boats Aragon hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the Rapids boats of the elves would not sink maybe he said but that does not say that we should come through San gabir alive none have ever done so yet no Road was made by the men of Gondor in this region for even in their great days their realm did not reach up andwin beyond the EM wheel but there is a Portage way somewhere on the western shore if I can

          
          19:03:13
          find it it cannot yet have perished for light boats used to Journey out of wilderland down to O gillath and still did so until a few years ago when the Orcs of Mordor began to multiply seldom in my life as any boat come out of the North and the Orcs prowl on the East Shore said Boromir if you go forward Peril will grow with every mile even if you find a path Peril lies ahead on every Southward Road answered Aragon wait for us one day if we do not return in that time you will know that evil has indeed befallen us

          
          19:03:53
          then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can it was with a heavy heart that froo saw Aragon and Legolas climb the Steep bank and vanish Into The Mists but his fears proved groundless only two or three hours had passed and it was barely midday when the shadowy shapes of the Explorers appeared again all is well said Aragon as he clambered down the bank there is a track and it leads to a good Landing that is still serviceable the distance is not great the head of the Rapids is but half a

          
          19:04:30
          mile below us and they are little more than a mile long not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again though it runs swiftly our hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old Portage way we've found it but it lies well back from the water side here and runs under the Lee of a rock wall a furong or more from the shore we did not find where the northward landing lies if it still remains we must have passed it yesterday night we might labor far upstream and yet miss it in the fog

          
          19:05:07
          I fear we must leave the river now and make for the Portage way as best we can from here that would not be easy even if we were all men said Boromir yet such as we are we will try it said Aragorn I we will said gimy the legs of men will lag on a rough road while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice his own weight Master Boromir the task proved hard indeed yet in the end it was done the goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank where there was a level space then the boats were drawn

          
          19:05:47
          out of the water and carried up they were far less heavy than any had expected of what tree growing in the Elish country they were made not even Legolas knew but the wood was tough and yet strangely light Mary and Pippen alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to lift and haul them over the ground that the company now had had to cross it sloped up away from the river a tumbled waste of gray Limestone Boulders with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes

          
          19:06:25
          there were thickets of brambles and sheer Dells and here and there bogy pools fed by Waters trickling from The Terraces further in Land one by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats while the others toiled and scrambled after them with a baggage at last was removed and laid on the Portage way then with little further hindrance safe from sprawling briers and many Fallen Stones they moved forward all together fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock wall and to their left Mist shrouded the river they

          
          19:07:02
          could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stonely Teeth of San Gia but they could not see it twice they made the journey before all was brought safe to the southern Landing there the Portage way turning back to the water side ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little pool it seemed to have been scooped in the Riverside not by hand but by the water swirling down from San Gia against a low Pier of rock that jotted out some way into the stream Beyond it the shore Rose Shear into a great cliff and there was

          
          19:07:40
          no further passage for those on foot all already the short afternoon was passed and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in they sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and Roar of the Rapids hidden in the Mist they were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day well here we are and here we must pass another night said bmir we need sleep and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the gates of argonath by night we all all too tired except no doubt our sturdy dwarf gimy made no reply he was

          
          19:08:20
          nodding as he sat let us rest as much as we can now said Aragon tomorrow we must journey by day again unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we shall have a good chance of slipping through unseen by any eyes on the Eastern Shore but tonight two must watch together in turns 3 hours off and one on guard nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before Dawn as soon as it was fully light they started already the fog was thinning they kept as close as they could to the western side and they could

          
          19:09:00
          see the dim shapes of the low Cliffs Rising ever higher shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying River in the midm morning the clouds Drew down lower and it began to rain heavily they drew the skin covered was over their boats to prevent them from being flooded and drifted on little could be seen before them or about them through the gray falling curtains the rain however did not last long slowly the sky above grew lighter and then suddenly the clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed

          
          19:09:33
          away northward up the river the fogs and Mists were gone before The Travelers lay a wide Ravine with great Rocky sides to which clung upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thown trees the channel grew narrower and the river swifter now they were speeding along with little hopes of stopping or turning whatever they might meet ahead over them was a lane of pale blue sky around them the dark overshadowed river and before them black shutting out the Sun the hills of Emin whe in which no opening could be seen fro peering

          
          19:10:14
          forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching like great Pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream a narrow Gap appeared between them and the river swept the boats towards it behold the argonath the pillars of the Kings cried Aragon we shall pass them soon keep the boats in line and as far apart as you can hold the middle of the Stream as Frodo was born towards them the great pillars Rose like Towers to meet them Giants they seemed to him vast gray

          
          19:10:52
          figures silent but threatening then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned the craft and power of old had root upon them and still they preserved through the Suns and rains of Forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hee upon great pedestals founded in the Deep Waters stood two great Kings of stone still with blurred eyes and craned brows they frowned upon the north the left hand of each was raised Palm outwards in gesture of warning in each right hand there was an axe upon each head there

          
          19:11:26
          was a crumbling Helm and Crown great power and magesty they still wore the silent wardens of a long vanished Kingdom awe and fear fell upon Frodo and he cowed down shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat Drew near even Bor bowed his head as the boats Whirled by frail and fleeting as little leaves under the enduring shadow of the Sentinels of new Manor so they passed into the dark Chasm of the gates sheer Rose the Dreadful Cliffs to unguessed Heights on either side far off was the dim Sky the black Waters roared

          
          19:12:06
          and echoed and a wind screamed over them throo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering and groaning what a place what a horrible place let me get out of this boat and I'll Never Wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a river fear not said a strange voice behind him Frodo turned and saw Strider and yet not strider for the weather-worn ranger was no longer there in the stern sat Aragorn son of arthorn proud and erect guiding the boat with skillful Strokes his hood was cast back and his

          
          19:12:43
          dark hair was blowing in the wind a light was in his eyes a king returning from exile to his own land fear not he said long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of isor and Arion my sers of old under their Shadow elesar the elfstone son of arathorn of the House of valandil islor's Son heir of elendil has not to dread then the light of his eyes faded and he spoke to himself would that Gandalf were here how my heart yearns for Min Anor and the walls of my own City but with now shall I go the chasm was long and dark and

          
          19:13:29
          filled with a noise of wind and Rushing Water and echoing Stone it bent somewhat towards the West so that at first all was dark ahead but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before him ever growing swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boat shot through out into a wide clear light the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy Sky the pent water spread out into a long oval Lake pale nen hith oil fenced by steep gray Hills whose sides were clad with trees but their heads were bare cold

          
          19:14:07
          gleaming in the sunlight at the far southern end Rose Three Peaks the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from them an island in the waters about which the flowing river flung pale shimmering arms distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the Roll of Thunder heard far away behold tall brandia said Aragon pointing South to the tall Peak upon the left stands Aron and upon the right his arm on hen the hills of hearing and of sight in the days of the great Kings there were seats upon them

          
          19:14:44
          and watch was kept there but it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upon tall Brer a the shade of night falls we shall come to them I hear the endless voice of Ros calling the company rested now for a while drifting south on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake they ate some food and then they took to their paddles and hastened on their way the sides of the westward Hills fell into Shadow and the Sun grew round and red here and there a misty star peered out the Three

          
          19:15:18
          Peaks loomed before them darkling in the Twilight Ros was roaring with a great voice already night was laid on the flowing Waters when The Travelers came at last under the shadow of the hills the 10th day of their Journey was over wilderland was behind them they could go no further without choice between the East way and the West the last stage of the quest was before them chapter 10 the breaking of the fellowship Aragorn LED them to the right arm of the river here upon its western side under the shadow of tall brander a

          
          19:16:04
          green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of Armon hen behind it Rose the first gentle slopes of the Hill clad with trees and trees marched away Westward along the curving shores of the lake a little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass here we will rest tonight said Aragon this is the lawn of path Garland a fair place in the summer days of old let us hope that no evil has yet come here they drew up their boats on the Green Banks and beside them they made their Camp they set a watch but had no

          
          19:16:41
          sight nor sound of their enemies if Gollum had contrived to follow them he remained unseen and unheard nonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew uneasy tossing off in his sleep and waking in the small hours he got up and came to Frodo whose turn it was to watch why are you waking asked Frodo it is not your watch I don't know answered Aragon but a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep it would be well to draw your sword why said Frodo are enemies at hand let us see what sting may show answered

          
          19:17:22
          Aragorn Frodo then drew the elf blade from its sheath to his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the night Orcs he said not very near and yet too near it seems I feared as much said Aragon but maybe they are not on this side of the river the light of Sting is faint and it may point to no more than Spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Arman I have never heard before Of Orcs upon arm on head yet who knows what may happen in these evil days now that Min tith no longer holds secure the passages of andwin we must go weily

          
          19:18:05
          tomorrow the day came like fire and smoke low in the East there were black bars of cloud like the fumes of of a great burning the Rising Sun lit them from beneath with flames of murky red but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky the summit of tall Brer was tipped with gold Frodo looked out Eastward and gazed at The Tall Island its side sprang sheer out of the running water high up above the tall Cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed mounting one head above another and above them again were gray faces of

          
          19:18:43
          inaccessible Rock crowned by a great Spire of stone many birds were circling about it but no sign of other living things could be seen when they had eaten Aragorn called the company together the day has come at last he said the day of choice which we have long delayed what shall now become of our company that has traveled so far in Fellowship shall we turn west with bomir and go to the wars of Gondor or turn East to the fear and Shadow or shall we break up our fellowship and go this way and that as each may

          
          19:19:22
          choose whatever we do must be done soon we cannot long halt here the enemy is on the Eastern Shore we know but I fear that the Orcs may already be on this side of the water there was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved well Frodo said Aragon at last I fear that the burden is laid upon you you are the bearer appointed by the council your own way you alone can choose in this matter I cannot advise you I am not Gandalf and though I have tried to bear his part I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour

          
          19:20:03
          if indeed he had any most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait on you such is your fate Frodo didn't answer at once then he spoke slowly I know that haste is needed yet I cannot choose the burden is heavy give me an hour longer and I will speak let me be alone Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity very well Frodo son of Drogo he said you shall have an hour and you shall be alone we will stay here for a while but do not stray far or out of call Frodo sat for a moment with his head

          
          19:20:46
          bowed Sam who had been watching his master with great concern shook his head and muttered plain as a pike stuff it is but it's no good Sam gamji putting in his spoke just now presently Frodo got up and walked away and Sam saw that while the others restrained themselves and did not stare at him the eyes of Boromir followed Frodo intently until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of our Armon hen wandering aimlessly at first in the wood Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the

          
          19:21:21
          Hill he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago in steep places stairs of stone had been heun but now they were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees for some while he climbed not caring which way he went until he came to a grassy place Rowan trees grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone the little Upland lawn was open upon the East and was filled now with the early sunlight Frodo halted and looked out over the river far below him to tall brander and the birds

          
          19:22:01
          wheeling in the Great Gulf of air between him and the untrodden Isle the voice of raos was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom he sat down upon the stone and cued his chin in his hands staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes all that had happened since Bilbo left the show was passing through his mind and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf's words time went on and still he was no nearer to a choice suddenly he awoke from his thoughts a strange feeling came to him

          
          19:22:39
          that something was behind him that had friendly eyes were upon him he sprang up and turned but all that he saw to his surprise was Boromir and his face was smiling and kind I was afraid for you Frodo he said coming forward if Aragorn is right and Orcs are near then none of us should wander alone and you least of all so much depends on you and my heart too is heavy may I stay now and talk for a while since I found you it would comfort me where there are so many all speech becomes a debate Without End but two

          
          19:23:16
          together May perhaps find wisdom you're kind answered Frodo but I don't think that any speech will help for I know what I should do but I'm afraid of doing it Boromir afraid Boromir stood silent Ros roared endlessly on the Wind murmured in the branches of the trees Frodo shivered suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly he said I wish to help you you need counsel in your hard choice will you not take mine I think I know already what counsel you would give bmir said Frodo and it

          
          19:23:59
          would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart warning warning against what said bmir sharply against delay against the way that seems easier against refusal of the burden that is laid on me against well if it must be said against trust in the strength and truth of men yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little country though you knew it not I don't doubt The Valor of your people but the world is changing the walls of Min tith may be strong but they are not strong enough if they fail what

          
          19:24:41
          then we shall fall in battle valiantly but there is still hope that they will not fail no hope while the ring lasts said Frodo ah the ring said bmir his eyes lighting the ring is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing so small a thing and I have seen it only for an instant in the house of elod could I not have a sight of it again throo looked up his heart went suddenly cold he caught the strange gleam in boromir's eyes yet his face was still kindly and

          
          19:25:22
          friendly it is best that it should lie hidden he answered as you wish I care not said Boromir yet may I not even speak of it for you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of its good the world is changing you say tith will fall if the ring lasts but why certainly if the ring were with the Enemy but why if it were with us were you not at the council answered Frodo because we cannot use it and what is done with it turns to evil bmir got up and walked about

          
          19:26:04
          impatiently so you go on he cried gandal ilon all these folk of torture to so for themselves they may be right these elves and half elves and wizards they would come to grief perhaps yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid but each to his own kind true-hearted men they will not be corrupted we of Min tith of been Storch through long years of trial we do not desire the power of wizard Lords only strength to defend ourselves strengthen a just cause and behold in our need a chance brings to

          
          19:26:45
          light the ring of power it's a gift I say a gift to the foes of Mordor it's mad not to use it to use the power of the enemy against him the Fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve Victory what could not a warrior do in this hour a great leader what could not Aragon do or if he refuses why not borrow me the ring would give me power of command how I would drive the hosts of Mordor and all men would flock to my banner bomis strolled up and down speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to have

          
          19:27:23
          forgotten Frodo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons and the mustering of men and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories to be and he cast down Mordor and became himself a mighty king benevolent and wise suddenly he stopped and waved arms and they tell us to throw it away he cried I do not say destroy it that might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so it does not the only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk blindly into Mordor and offer the enemy every chance of

          
          19:28:05
          recapturing it for himself Folly surely you see it my friend he said turning now suddenly to Frodo again you say that you're afraid if it's so the boldest should pardon you but is it not really your good sense that revolts no I'm afraid said Frodo simply afraid but I'm glad to have heard you speak so fully my mind is clearer now then you will come to Min tith cried bmir his eyes were shining and his face eager you misunderstand me said Frodo but you will come at least for a while bomy persisted my city is not far

          
          19:28:51
          now and it's little further from there to Mordor than from here we've been long in the wilderness and you need news of what the enemy is doing before you can make a move come with me rodo he said you need rest before your Venture if go you must he laid his hand on the hobbit's shoulder in Friendly fashion but Frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement he stepped quickly away and eyed with alarm the tall man nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength why are you so unfriendly said

          
          19:29:27
          Boromir I'm a true man neither Thief nor tracker I need your ring that you know now but I give you my word that I don't desire to keep it will you not at least let me make trial of my plan lend me the ring no no cried Frodo the council laid it upon me to Bear it it's by our own Folly that the enemy will defeat us cried bmir how it angers me fool obstinate fool running willfully to death and ruining our cause if any Mortals have claimed to the ring it is the men of numor and not halflings it is not yours save by unhappy chance it

          
          19:30:09
          might have been mine it should be mine give it to me thoro did not answer but moved away till the great flat stone stood between them come come my friend said Boromir in a softer voice why not get rid of it why not be free of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame on me if you will you can say that I was too strong and took it by force but I'm too strong for you halfling he cried and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leapt at Frodo his fair and pleasant face was hideously changed a raging fire

          
          19:30:45
          was in his eyes Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them there was only one thing he could do trembling he pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger even as Boromir sprang at him again the man gasped stared for a moment amazed and then ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rocks and trees miserable trickster he shouted let me get my hand on you now I see your mind you will take the ring to saurin and sell us all you have only waited your chance to leave us in the Lurch curse

          
          19:31:22
          you and all halflings to death and darkness then catching his foot on a stone he felt sprawling and lay upon his face for a while he was as still as if his own curse had struck him down then suddenly he wept he rose and passed his hand over his eyes dashing away the tears what what have I said he cried what have I done Frodo Frodo he called come back a Madness took me but it has passed come back there was no answer Frodo did not even hear his cries he was already far away leaping blindly up the path to the

          
          19:32:03
          hilltop Terror and grief shook him seeing in his thought the Mad Fierce face of Boromir and his burning eyes soon he came out alone on the summit of Armon hen and halted gasping for breath he saw as through a Mist a wide flat circle paved with Mighty flags and surrounded with a crumbling Battlement and in the middle set upon four carven pillars was a high seat reached by a stair of many steps up he went and sat upon the ancient chair feeling like a lost child that had clamored upon the throne of mountain Kings

          
          19:32:42
          at first he could see little he seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only Shadows the ring was upon him then here and there the Mist gave way and he saw many Visions small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table and yet remote there was no sound only bright living images the world seemed to have shrunk and Fallen silent he was sitting upon the seat of seeing on arm on hen the hill of the eye of the men of numo Eastward he looked into wide Uncharted lands nameless Plains and

          
          19:33:22
          forests unexplored northward he looked and the Great River lay like a ribbon beneath him and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth Westward he looked and saw the broad pastes of Rohan and orthon the Pinnacle of Eisen guard like a black Spike Southward he looked and Below his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of raos into a foaming pit a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume and a andwin he saw the mighty delter of the river and myriads of seabirds whirling

          
          19:34:02
          like a white dust in the sky and beneath them a green and silver sea Rippling in Endless lines but everywhere he looked he saw the signs of War the Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills Orcs were issuing out of a thousand holes under the bows of merkwood there was a deadly Strife of elves and men and fell beasts the land of the beornings was a flame a cloud was over Moria smoke rose on the borders of lauan Horsemen were Galloping on the grass of Rohan wolves poured from Eisen God from the

          
          19:34:39
          Havens of harod ships of War put out to see and out of the East men were moving endlessly Swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses Chariots of Chieftain and Laden Wes all the part of the dark lord was in motion then turning South again he beheld Minas tith far away it seemed and beautiful white walled many towered proud and fair upon its Mountain seat its battlements glittered with steel and its tant were bright with many banners hope leapt in his heart but against Min tith was set another Fortress greater

          
          19:35:18
          and more strong thither Eastward unwilling his eye was drawn it passed the ruined bridges of O gillath the grinning Gates of Min morgo and the haunted mountains and it looked upon gor gorath The Valley Of Terror in the land of Mordor Darkness lay there under the sun fire glowed amid the smoke mount Doom was burning and a great reek Rising then at last his gaze was held wall upon wall Battlement upon Battlement black immeasurably strong mountain of Iron Gate of Steel Tower of adamant he saw it Bar D Fortress of

          
          19:36:01
          saen all hope left him and suddenly he felt the eye there was an eye in the Dark Tower that did not sleep he knew that it had become aware of his gaze a fierce eager will was there it leaped towards him almost like a finger he felt it searching for him very soon it would nail him down know just exactly where he was arm on it touched it glanced upon tall Brer he threw himself from the seat crouching covering his head with his gray Hood he heard himself crying out never never or was it verily I come I come to you he

          
          19:36:50
          could not tell then as a flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another thought take it off take it off fool take it off take off the ring the two powers strove in him for a moment perfectly balanced between their piercing points he writhed tormented suddenly he was aware of himself self again Frodo neither The Voice nor the eye free to choose and with one remaining instant in which to do so he took the ring off his finger he was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat a black shadow seemed to pass

          
          19:37:28
          like an arm above him it missed arm on hen and groped out west and Faded then all the sky was clean and blue and Birds Sang in every tree Frodo Rose to his feet a great weirdness was on him but his will was firm and his heart lighter he spoke aloud to himself I will do now what I must he said this at least is plain the evil of the ring is already at work even in the company and the ring must leave them before it does more harm I'll go alone some I cannot trust and those I can trust are too dear to me poor old

          
          19:38:10
          Sam and Med and Pippen Strider too his heart yearns for minth and he will be needed there now Boromir has fallen into evil I will go alone at once he went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where bmir had found him then he halted listening he thought he could hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore below they'll be hunting for me he said I wonder how long I have been aware hours I should think he hesitated what can I do he muttered I must go now or I shall never go I Shan get a chance again

          
          19:38:52
          I hate leaving them and like this without any explanation but surely they'll understand Samu and what else can I do slowly he drew out the ring and put it on once more he vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of the Wind the others remained long by the Riverside for some time they had been silent moving restlessly about but now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking every now and again they made efforts to speak of other things of their long road and Many Adventures they

          
          19:39:30
          questioned Aragon concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history and the remnants of its great works that could still be seen in the strange Borderland of the Emin wheel the stone Kings and the seats of claw and hen and the great stare beside the Falls of Ros but always their thoughts and words strayed back to Frodo in the ring what would Frodo choose to do why was he hesitating he's debating which course is the most desperate I think said Aragon and well he may it's now more hopeless than ever for the company to go East

          
          19:40:09
          since we have been tracked by Gollum and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed but Min tith is no nearer to the fire and the destruction of the burden we may remain there for a while and make a brave stand but the Lord denior and all his men cannot hope to do what even elron said was beyond his power either to keep the burden secret or to hold off the full might of the enemy when he comes to take it which way would any of us choose in Frodo's place I don't know now indeed we miss gandal most Grievous

          
          19:40:46
          is our loss said Legolas yet we must needs make up our minds without his Aid why cannot we decide and so help Frodo let us call him back and then vote I should vote for Min terth and so should I said gimy we of course were only sent to help the bearer along the road to go no further than we wished and none of us is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom hard was my parting from llan yet I have come so far and I say this now we have reached the Last Choice it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo

          
          19:41:27
          I would choose Minister tith but if he does not then I follow him and I too will go with him said Legolas it would be faithless now to say farewell it would indeed be betrayal if we all left him said Aragon but if he goes east then all need not go with him nor do I think that all should that Venture is desperate as much so for eight as for three or two or one alone if you would let me choose then I should appoint three companions Sam who could not bear it otherwise and gimy and myself Boromir will return to

          
          19:42:08
          his own City where his father and his people need him and with him the others should go or at least maradok and perigrine if legalis is not willing to leave us that won't do at all cried Mary we can't leave Frodo Pippin and I always intended to go whereever he went and we still do but we didn't realize what that would mean it seemed different so far away in the Shire or in rivendale it would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor why can't we stop him we must stop him said Pippen and that is what

          
          19:42:47
          he's worrying about I'm sure he knows we Shan agree to his going east and he doesn't like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow imagine it going off to Mordor alone Pippen shuddered but the dear silly old Hobbit he ought to know that he hasn't got to ask he ought to know that if we can't stop him we sh leave him begging your pardon said Sam I don't think you understand my master at all he isn't hesitating about which way to go of course not what's the good of Min tith anyway to him I mean begging

          
          19:43:24
          your pardon Master Boromir he added and turned it was then that they discovered that bmir who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle was no longer there now where's he got to cried Sam looking worried he's been a bit queer lately to my mind but anyway he's not in this business he's off to his home as he always said and no blame to him but Mr Frodo he knows he's got to find the cracks of Doom if he can but he's afraid now it's come to the point he's just plain terrified that's what

          
          19:44:02
          his trouble is of course he's had a bit of schooling so to speak we all have since we left home or he'd be so Terri fight did just fling the ring in the river and boat but he's still too frightened to start and he isn't worrying about us either whether we'll go along with him or no he knows we mean to that's another thing that's bothering him if he screws himself up to go he'll want to go alone mark my words we're going to have trouble when he comes back for he'll screw himself up all right as sure as his name's

          
          19:44:39
          baggin I believe you speak more wisely than any of us Sam said Aragon and what shall we do if you prove right stop him don't let him go cried Pippen I wonder said Aragon he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on him I don't think that it's our part to drive him one way or the other nor do I think that we should succeed if we tried there are other powers at work far stronger well I wish froda would screw himself up and come back and let us get it over said Pippen this waiting is horrible surely the time is up yes said

          
          19:45:22
          Aragon the hour is long past the morning is wearing away we must call for him at that moment borom reappeared he came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking his face looked grim and sad he paused as if ing those that were present and then sat down aloof with his eyes on the ground where have you been Boromir asked Aragon have you seen Frodo Boromir hesitated for a second yes and no he answered slowly yes I found him some way up the hill and I spoke to him I urged him to come to Min

          
          19:46:05
          tythan not to go East I grew angry and he left me he vanished I've never seen such a thing happen before though I have heard of it in Tales he must have put the ring on I could not find him again I thought he would return to you is that all you have to say said Aragon looking hard and not too kindly at bmir yes he answered I will say no more yet that is bad cried Sam jumping up I don't know what this man has been up to Why should Mr Frodo put put the thing on he didn't ought to have and if he has

          
          19:46:45
          goodness knows what may have happened but he wouldn't keep it on said Mary not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor like Bilbo used to but where did he go where is he cried Pippin he's been away ages now how long is it since you saw Frodo last Boromir asked Aragon half an hour maybe he answered or it might be ah I've wandered for some time since I don't know I don't know he put his head in his hands and sat as if bowed with grief an hour since he vanished shouted Sam we must try and find him at once

          
          19:47:26
          come on wait a moment cried Aragon we must divide up into Pairs and arrange here hold on wait it was no good they took no notice of him Sam had dashed off first Mary and Pippen followed and they were already disappearing Westward into the trees by the shore shouting Frodo Frodo in their clear High Hobbit voices Legolas and gimle were running a sudden Panic or Madness seemed to have fallen on the company we shall all be scattered and lost groaned Aragorn barir I do not know what part you have played in this Mischief but help now go

          
          19:48:07
          after those two young Hobbits and guard them at the least even if you can cannot find Frodo come back to this spot if you find him or any traces of him I shall return soon Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam just as he reached the little lawn among the row he overtook him toiling up hill panting and calling Frodo Come With Me Sam he said none of us should be alone there is Mischief about I feel it I'm going to the top to the seat of Arman hen to see what may be seen and look it is as my heart guessed Frodo

          
          19:48:46
          went this way follow me and keep your eyes open he sped up The Path Sam did his best but he could not keep up with stride of the Ranger and soon fell behind he'd not gone far before Aragon was out of sight ahead Sam stopped and puffed suddenly he clapped his hand to his head who Sam gamji he said aloud your legs are too short so use your head let me see now bamir isn't lying that's not his way but he hasn't told us everything something scared Mr Frodo badly he screwed himself up to the point sudden he made up his mind at last to go

          
          19:49:28
          where too off East not without Sam yes without even his Sam that's hard cruel hard Sam passed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tears steady gamji he said think if you can he can't fly across rivers and he can't jump waterfalls he's got no gear so he's got to get back to the boats back to the boats back to the boat Sam like lightning Sam turned and bolted back down the path he fell and cut his knees up he got and ran on he came to the edge of the lawn of path Garin by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the

          
          19:50:13
          water no one was there there seemed to be cries in the woods behind but he did not Eed them he stood gazing for a moment stock still gaping a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself with a shout Sam raced across the grass the boat slipped into the water coming Mr Frodo coming called Sam and flung himself from the bank clutching at the departing boat he missed it by a yard with a cry and a splash he fell face downward into the deep Swift water gurgling he went under and the river closed over his curly head

          
          19:50:53
          an exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat a paddle swirled and the boat put about Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he came up bubbling and struggling fear was staring in his round brown eyes up you come Sam my lad said from Frodo now take my hand save me Mr Frodo gasped Sam I'm drowned I can't see your hand here it is don't pinch lad I Won't Let You Go tread water and don't flounder or you'll upset the boat there now get hold of the side and let me use the paddle with a few Strokes Frodo

          
          19:51:30
          brought the boat back to the bank and Sam was able to scramble out wet as a water rat Frodo took off the ring and stepped ashore again of all the a confounded nuisance as you're the worst Sam he said oh Mr Frodo that's a hard said Sam shivering that's hard trying to go without me and all if I hadn't guessed right where would you be now safely on my way safely said Sam all alone and without me to help you I couldn't have a borne it it would have been the death of me it would be the death of you to come with me Sam

          
          19:52:07
          said Frodo and I could not have borne that not certain as being left behind said Sam but I am going to Mordor I know that well enough Mr Frodo of course you are and I'm coming with you now Sam said Frodo don't hinder me the others will be coming back at any minute if they catch me here I shall have to argue and explain and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off but I must go at once it's the only way of course it is answered Sam but not alone I'm coming too or neither of us isn't going I'll knock old it all

          
          19:52:48
          the boats first Frodo actually laughed a sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart leave one he said we'll need it but you can't come like this without your gear or food or anything just old on a moment and I'll get my stuff cried Sam eagerly it's all ready I thought we should be off today he rushed to the camping Place fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he emptied the boat of his companion's Goods grabbed a spare blanket and some extra packages of food and ran back so all my plan is spoiled said

          
          19:53:29
          Frodo it's no good trying to escape you but I'm glad Sam I can't tell you how glad come along it's plain that we were meant to go together we will go and may the others find a safe road Strider will look after them I don't suppose we shall see them again yet we may Mr Frodo we may said Sam so Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the quest together Frodo paddled away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly away down the Western arm and past the frowning Cliffs of tall brandia the Roar of the Great Falls Drew

          
          19:54:11
          nearer even with such help as Sam could give it was hard work to pass across the current at the Southward end of the island and drive the boat Eastward towards the far Shore at length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon there they found a shelving Shore and they drew the boat out high above the water and hid it as well as they could behind a great Boulder then shouldering their burdens they set off seeking up path that would bring them over the gray Hills of the EM wheel and down into the land of

          19:55:45
          Footprints are not easy even for a ranger to read but not far from the top a spring crossed the path and in the wet Earth he saw what he was seeking I read the signs are right he said to himself Frodo ran to the hilltop I wonder what he saw there but he returned by the same way and went down the hill again Aragorn hesit ated he desired to go to the high seat himself hoping to see there something that would guide him in his perplexities but time was pressing suddenly he leapt forward and ran to the

          
          19:56:24
          summit across the Great flagstones and up the steps then sitting in the high seat he looked out but the sun seemed darkened and the world dim and remote he turned from the north back again to the north and saw nothing save the distant Hills unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird Like an Eagle high in the air descending slowly in wide circles down towards the Earth even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in The Woodlands Below on the west side of the river he stiffened

          
          19:57:02
          there were cries and among them to his hter he could distinguish the harsh voices of Orcs then suddenly with a deep throated call a Great Horn blew and the blasts of it smoked the hills and echoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout above the Roaring of the falls the Horn of Boromir he cried he is in need he sprang down the steps and Away leaping down the path alas an ill fate is on me this day and all that I do goes amiss where is Sam as he ran the cries came louder but fainter now and desperately the horn was

          
          19:57:48
          blowing Fierce and shrill Rose the yells of the Orcs and suddenly the horn call ceased Aragon raced down the last slope but before he could reach the hills foot The Sounds died away and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated until at last he could hear them no more Dr in his bright sword and crying elendil elendil he crashed through the trees a mile maybe from path Garland in a little Glade not far from the lake he found Boromir he was sitting with his back to a great trig as if he was resting but

          
          19:58:30
          Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black feathered arrows his sword was still in his hand but it was broken near the hilt his horn clover in TOS at his his side many Orcs lay slain piled all about him and At His Feet Aragon knelt beside him bmir opened his eyes and strove to speak at last slow words came I tried to take the ring from Frodo he said I'm sorry I have paid his glance strayed to his Fallen enemies 20 at least lay there they have gone the halflings the Orcs have taken them I think they are not dead Orcs

          
          19:59:17
          bound them he paused and his eyes closed wearily after a moment he spoke again farewell aror go to Min tith and save my people I failed no said Aragon taking his hand and kissing his brow you have conquered few have gained such a victory be at peace Min tith shall not fall boramy smiled which way did they go was froda there said Aragon but Boromir did not speak again alas said Aragon thus passes the heir of denior Lord of the Tower of God this is a Bitter End now that company is all in ruin it is I that have failed

          
          20:00:11
          vain was Gandalf's trust in me what shall I do now bomir has laid it on me to go to minth and my heart desires it but where are the ring and the bearer how shall I find them and save the quest from disaster he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clasping bm's hand so it was that Legolas and gimy found him they came from the Western slopes of the Hill still silently creeping through the trees as if they were hunting gimle had his ax in his hand and legus his long knife all his arrows were spent when they came into

          
          20:00:52
          the Glade they halted in amazement and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief for it seemed to them plain what had happened alas said Legolas coming to Aragon side we have hunted and slain many Orcs in the wood but we should have been of more use here we came when we heard the horn but too late it seems I fear you have taken deadly hurt Boromir is dead said Aragon I'm unscathed for I was not here with him he fell defending the hobbits while I was away upon the hill the hobbits cried gimy where are

          
          20:01:34
          they then where's rodo I don't know answered Aragon weily but before he died bmir told me that the Orcs had bound them he didn't think that they were dead I sent him to follow Mary and Pippin but I didn't ask him if froo Sam were with him not until it was too late all that I've done today has gone a Miss what's to be done now first we must tend the Fallen said legalis we cannot leave him lying like caran among these foul Orcs but we must bewe sft said gimy he wouldn't wish us to linger we must follow the Orcs if there's hope

          
          20:02:17
          that any of our company of living prisoners but we don't know whether the ring bearer is with them or not said Aragon are we to abandon him must we not seek Him First an evil choice is now before us then let us do first what we must do said legalis we have not the time or the tools to bury our comp LA fitly or to raise a mound over him a can we might build the labor would be hard and long there are no stones that we could use nearer than the water side said gimy then let us lay him in a boat with

          
          20:02:56
          his weapons and the weapons of his vanquished foes said Aragon we will send him to the Falls of raos and give him to andwin the river of Gondor will take care at least that no evil creature dishonors his bones quickly they searched the bodies of the Orcs Gathering their swords and clover Helms and shields into a heap see cried Aragon here we find tokens he picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives Leaf bladed damasked in gold and red and searching further he found also the sheads black set with small red

          
          20:03:38
          gems no orc tools these he said they were born by the hobbits doubtless the Orcs despoil them but feared to keep the knives knowing them for what they are work of westernness wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor well now if they still live our friends are weaponless I'll take these things hoping against hope to give them back and I said Legolas will take all the arrows that I can find for my quiver is empty he searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the

          
          20:04:21
          shaft than such arrows as the Orcs were accustomed to use he looked at them closely and Aragorn looked on the slain and he said here lie many that are not folk of Mordor some are from the north from the Misty Mountains if I know anything of Orcs and their kinds and here are others strange to me their gear is not after the manner Of Orcs at all there were four Goblin soldiers of Greater stature swart slant eyed with thick legs and large hands they were armed with short broad-bladed swords not with a curved scimitars usual with Orcs

          
          20:05:03
          And they had bows of you in length and shape like the bows of men upon their Shield they bore a strange device a small white hand in the center of a black field on the front of their iron Helms was set an S run rought of some white metal I have not seen these tokens before said Aragon what do they mean s is for sain said gimy that is easy to read nay said legus saurin does not use the elf runes neither does he use his right name nor permit it to be spelled or spoken said Aragon and he does not use white the Orcs in the service of

          
          20:05:48
          bador use the sign of the red eye he stood for a moment and thought s is for San I guess he said at length there is evil a foot in Eisen guard and the West is no longer safe it is as gandal feared by some means the traitor San has had news of our journey it's likely too that he knows of gandal fall pursuers from Moria may have escaped the vigilance of lauan or they may have avoided that land and come to ice and guard by other paths Orcs travel fast B San has many ways of learning news do you remember the

          
          20:06:28
          birds well we have no time to ponder riddles said gimy let us bear bomir away but after that we must Guess The Riddles if we are to choose our course rightly answered Aragorn maybe there is no right choice said gimy taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches these they lashed together with bow strings and spread their cloaks upon the frame upon this rough beer They Carried the body of their companion to the shore together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with

          
          20:07:08
          him it was only a short way yet they found it no easy task for bmir was a man both tall and strong at the water side Aragorn remained watching the beer while Legolas and gimy hastened back on foot to path Garland it was a mile or more and it was some time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore there is a strange tale to tell said Legolas there are only two boats upon the bank we could find no trace of the other have Orcs been there asked Aragon we saw no signs of them answered

          
          20:07:48
          gimy and Orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats and the baggage as well I will look at the ground when we come there said Aragon now they laid bomir in the middle of the boat that was to Bear him away the gray hood and Elven cloak they folded and placed beneath his head they combed his long dark hair and a radiant upon his shoulders the Golden Belt of laurian gleamed about his waist his Helm they set beside him and across his lap they laid the clove and horn and the hilts and shards of his sword beneath

          
          20:08:25
          his feet they put the swords of his enemies then fastening the proud to the stern of the other boat they drew him out into the water they rode sadly along the shore and turning into the Swift running Channel they past the green sword of path Garland the steep sides of TL Branda were glowing it was now mid-afternoon as they went South the fume of Ros Rose and shimmered before them a haze of gold the rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat there Boromir lay restful

          
          20:09:07
          peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the the flowing water the stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles he floated by them and slowly his boat departed waning to a dark spot against the golden light and then suddenly at vanished Ros roared on unchanging the river had taken Boromir son of denior and he was not seen again in Min tith standing as he used to stand upon the White Tower in the morning but in Gondor in after days it long was said that the Elven boat rode the falls

          
          20:09:46
          and the foaming pool and bore him down through o gilo and pass the many miles of andwin out into the great sea at night under the stars for a while the three companions remained silent gazing after him then Aragon spoke they will look for him from the White Tower he said but he will not return from Mountain or from sea then slowly he began to sing through over Fen and field where the long grass grows the West Wind comes walking and about the walls it goes what news from the West oh wondering wind do

          
          20:10:35
          you bring to me tonight have you seen seen borrow me the toall by moon or By Starlight I saw him ride over seven streams over Waters wide and gray I saw him walk in empty lands until he passed away into the Shadows of the north I saw him then no more The North Wind made have heard the Horn of the son of D B from the high walls Westward I looked AAR but you came not from the empty lands where no men are then legala sang from the mouths of the sea the south wind flies from the sand hills and the Stones The Wailing of the GS it bears

          
          20:11:47
          and at the gate it moans what news from the south or sighing wind do you bring to me at Eve where now is borrow me the fair he tear is and I grieve ask not of me where he Do Dwell so so many bones there lie on the white Shores and the dark Shores under the stormy sky so many have passed down and do to find the flowing sea Ask Of The North Wind news of them The North Wind sends to me oh borrow me beyond the gate the the seaward Road run south but you came not with a wailing gulls from the gra mouth then Aragon sang

          
          20:12:54
          again from the Gate of Kings a North Wind rides and past the Roaring Falls and clear and cold about the T it's loud horn cold s what news from the North or Mighty Wind do you bring to me today what news of Bor the B for he is long away beneath on H I heard his cry there many foes he fought his clo and shield his Broken Sword they to the water br his head so proud his face so fair his limbs they laid to rest and raos gold and Ros Falls bore him upon its breast oh Bor the to of God shall ever northward gaze to Rus gold and ra us

          
          20:14:05
          Falls until the end of day so they ended then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to path Garland you left the East Wind to me said gimy but I will say not of it that is as it should be said Aragon in Min tith they endure the East Wind but they do not ask it for Tidings but now bmir has taken his road and we must make haste to choose our own he surveyed the Green Lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping off to the Earth no Orcs have been on this ground he said

          
          20:14:53
          otherwise nothing can be made out for certain all our Footprints are here Crossing and recrossing I cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for Frodo began he returned to the bank close to where the real from the spring trickled out into the river there are some clear prints here he said a hobbit wed out into the water and back but I cannot say how long ago how then do you read this riddle asked gimy Aragon did not answer at once but went back to the camping place and

          
          20:15:29
          looked at the baggage two packs are missing he said and one is certainly Sam's it was rather large and heavy this then is the answer Frodo has gone by boat and his servant has gone with him Frodo must have returned while we were all away I met Sam going up the hill and told him to follow me but plainly he didn't do so he guessed his master's mind and came back here before Frodo had gone he didn't find it easy to leave Sam behind but why should he leave us behind and without a word said gimy that was a

          
          20:16:09
          strange deed and a brave deed said Aragon Sam was right I think Frodo didn't wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor but he knew that he must go himself something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled said Legolas he fled certainly said Aragon but not I think from Orcs what he thought was was the cause of Frodo's sudden resolve and flight Adon did not say the last words of bmir he long kept secret well so much at least is now

          
          20:16:51
          clear said legalis thodo is no longer on this side of the river only he can have taken the boat and Sam is with him only he would have taken his pack our choice then said gimy is either to take the remaining boat and follow Frodo or else to follow the Orcs on foot there is little hope either way we have already lost precious hours let me think said Aragorn and now may I make a right choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment I will follow the Orcs he said at

          
          20:17:31
          last I would have guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end but if I seek him now in the wilderness I must abandon the captives to torment and death my heart speaks clearly at last the fate of the bearer is in my hands no longer the company has played its part yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left come we will go now leave all that can be spared behind we will Press On by day and dark they drew up the last boat and carried it to the tree trees they laid

          
          20:18:10
          beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away then they left path Garland the afternoon was fading as they came back to the Glade where bmir had fallen there they picked up the trail of the Orcs it needed little skill to find no other folk make such a trampling said Legolas it seems their Delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way but they go with a great speed for all that said Aragorn and they do not tar and later we may have to search for our

          
          20:18:48
          path in bare hard lands well after them said gim dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not tie sooner than Orcs but it will be a long Chase they have a long start yes said Aragon we shall all need the endurance of dwarves but come with hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies and woe to them if we prove the swifter we will make such a Chase as shall be accounted a Marvel among the three kindreds elves dwarves and Men forth the three Hunters like a deer he sprang away through the trees he

          
          20:19:31
          sped on and on he led them tireless and Swift now that his mind was at last made up the woods about the lake they left behind long slopes they climbed dark hard edged against the sky already r with sunset dusk came they passed away gray shadows in a Stony land chapter 2 the Riders of Rohan dusk deepened Mist lay behind them among the trees below and broed on the pale margins of the andwin but the sky was clear stars came out the waxing moon was riding in the west and the Shadows of the Rocks were black they had come to

          
          20:20:25
          the feet of Stony Hills and their Pace was slower for the trail was no longer easy to follow here the highlands of the EM wheel ran from north to south in two long tumbled ridges the western side of each Ridge was Steep and difficult but the Eastward slopes were gentler fed with many gullies and narrow Ravines all night the three companions scrambled in this bony land climbing to the crest of the first and tallest Ridge and down again into the darkness of a deep Winding Valley on the other side there in the still cool hour before

          
          20:21:05
          Dawn they rested for a brief space the moon had long gone down before them the stars glittered above them the first light of day had not yet come over the dark Hills behind for the moment Aragorn was at a loss the orc Trail had descended into the valley but there it had vanished which way would they turn do you think said Legolas northward to take a straighter road to Eisen guard or fangorn if that is their aim as you guess or Southward to strike the anash they will not make for the river whatever Mark they aim at said

          
          20:21:47
          Aragorn and unless there is much a Miss in Rohan and the power of San is greatly increased they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of the rohim let us search northwards the Dale ran like a Stony trough between the ridged Hills and a trickling stream flowed Among The Boulders at the bottom a cliff frowned upon their right to their left Rose gray slopes dim and shadowy in the late night they went on for a mile or more northwards Adorn was searching bent towards the ground among the folds and

          
          20:22:31
          gullies leading up into the Western Ridge Legolas was some way ahead suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running towards him we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting he said look he pointed and they saw that what they had at first taken to be Boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies five dead Orcs lay there they had been heun with many cruel strokes and two had been beheaded the ground was wet with their dark blood here is a another riddle said gimy

          
          20:23:11
          but it needs the light of day and for that we cannot wait yet however you read it it seems not UNH hopeful said Legolas enemies of the Orcs are likely to be our friends do any folk dwell in these Hills no said Aragon the roam seldom come here and it is far from inth it might be that some company of men were hunting here for reasons that we do not know yet I think not what do you think said gimy I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him answered Aragon these are Northern Orcs from far away among the

          
          20:23:53
          slain are none of the great Orcs with the strange Badgers there was a quarrel I guess it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk maybe there was some dispute about the road or about the captives said gimy let us hope that they too did not meet their end here Aragon searched the ground in a Wide Circle but no other traces of the fight could be found they went on already the Eastward sky was turning pale the stars were fading and a gray light was slowly growing a little further north they came to a fold in

          
          20:24:32
          which a tiny stream falling and winding had cut a Stony path down into the valley in it some bushes grew and there were patches of grass upon its sides at last said Aragon here are the tracks that we seek up this water Channel this is the way that the Orcs went after their debate swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the New Path as if fresh from a night's rest they sprang from Stone to Stone at last they reached the crest of the gray Hill and a sudden Breeze blew in their hair and stirred their cloaks the chill wind

          
          20:25:08
          of dawn turning back they saw across the river the Far Hills kindled day leaped into the sky the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land before them in the west the world lay still formless and gray but even as they looked the Shadows Of Night melted the colors of the waking Earth returned green flowed over the wide mes of Rohan the white Mists shimmered in the water veils and far off to the left 30 leagues or more blue and purple stood the White Mountains Rising into peaks of jet

          
          20:25:46
          tipped with glimmering snows flushed with a rose of mourning Gondor Gondor cried Aragon would that I looked on you again in happier hour not yet does my road lie Southward to your bright streams Gondor Gondor between the mountains and the sea west wind blew there the light upon the silver tree fell like bright rain in Gardens of the kings of old oh proud walls white towers oh winged crown and Throne of gold oh Gondor Gondor shall men behold the Silver Tree or west wind blow again between the mountains and the Sea now

          
          20:26:31
          let us go he said drawing his eyes away from the south and looking out west and North to the way that he must tread the ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet below it 20 fathoms or more there was a wide and rugged shelf which entered suddenly in the brink of a sheer Cliff the East walls of Rohan so ended the Emin wheel and the green plains of the rerum stretched away before them to the edge of sight look cried Legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them there is

          
          20:27:13
          the eagle again he is very high he seems to be flying now away from this land back to the north he is going with great speed look no not even my eyes can see him my good legus said Aragon he must be far aoft indeed I wonder what is his errand and if he is the same bird that I have seen before but look look I can see something nearer at hand and more urgent there is something moving over the plane many things said legalis it is a great company on foot but I cannot say more nor see what kind of folk they may

          
          20:27:54
          be they are many leagues away 12 I guess but the flatness of the plane is hard to measure I think nonetheless that we no longer need any Trail to tell us which way to go said gimy let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the Orcs chose said Aragon they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day it seemed that the Orcs had pressed on with all possible speed every now and again the pursuers found things that had been

          
          20:28:33
          dropped or Cast Away food bags the rindes and crusts of hard gray bread a torn black cloak a heavy iron nailed shoe broken on the stones the trail LED them North along the top of the escarment and at length they came to a deep Cliff carved in the Rock by a stream that splashed noisily down in the narrow Ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair into the plain at the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of Rohan it welled like a green sea up to the very foot of the EM wheel the falling

          
          20:29:13
          stream vanished into a deep growth of crestes and water plants and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels down long gentle slopes towards the fens of vwash veil far away they seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind here the air was softer and warmer and faintly scented as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf legalis took a deep breath like one that drinks a great draft after long thirst in baren places ah the green smell he said it is

          
          20:29:53
          better than much sleep let us run light feet may run swiftly here said Aragorn more swiftly maybe the nrod Orcs now we have a chance to lessen their lead the they went in single file running like hounds on a strong scent and an eager light was in their eyes nearly Due West the broad swarth of the marching Orcs tramped its ugly slot the sweet grass of Rowan had been bruised and blackened as they passed presently Aragon gave a cry and turned aside stay he shouted do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the right away

          
          20:30:36
          from the main trail for he had seen footprints that went that way branching off from the others the marks of small unshod feet these however did not go far before they were crossed by orc prins also coming out from the main trail behind and in front and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the tramping at the furthest point Aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass then he ran back yes he said they are quite plain a hobbit Footprints Pippins I think he is smaller than the other and look at this

          
          20:31:16
          he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight it looked like the new open Leaf of a beach tree fair and strange in that treeless plain the brooch of an Elven cloak cried Legolas and gimly together not idly do the leaves of loran fall said Aragon this did not drop by chance it was cast away as a token to any that might follow I think Pippen ran away from the trail for that purpose then he at least was alive said gimy and he had the use of his wits and of his legs too this is heartening we do

          
          20:31:54
          not pursue in vain let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness said Legolas come let us go on the thought of those merry young folk driven like cattle burns my heart the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky light clouds came up out of the sea in the distant South and were blown away upon the breeze the sun sank Shadows Rose behind and reached out long arms from the East Still The Hunters held on one day now had passed since Boromir fell and the Orcs were yet far ahead no longer could

          
          20:32:36
          any sight of them be seen in the level Plaines as Nightshade was closing about them Ador halted only twice in the day's March had they rested for a brief while and 12 leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn we have come at last to a hard Choice he said shall we rest by night or shall we go on while our will and strength hold unless our enemies rest also they will leave us far behind if we stay to sleep said legus surely even Orcs Must pause on the March said gimly seldom

          
          20:33:17
          will Orcs journey in the open Under the Sun yet these have done so said Legolas certainly they will not rest by night but if we walk by night we cannot follow their Trail said gimy the trail is straight and turns neither right nor left as far as my eyes can see said Legolas maybe I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line said Aragon but if we strayed or they turned aside then when light came there might be a long delay before the trail was found again and there is this also said

          
          20:33:55
          gim only by day can we see if any tracks lead away if a prisoner should Escape or if one should be carried off Eastward say to the Great River toward Mordor we might pass the signs and never know it that is true said Aragorn but if I read the signs back Yonder rightly the Orcs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company is now Bound for Eisen guard their present course Bears me out yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimy and what of Escape in the dark we should have passed the signs

          
          20:34:33
          that led you to the broch the Orcs will be doubly on their guard since then and the prisoners even wearier said legalis there will be no escape again if we do not contrive it how that is to be done cannot be guessed but first we must overtake them and yet even I dwarf of many Journeys and not the least Hardy of my folk cannot run all the way to I andard without any pause said gimy my heart burned me too and I would have started sooner but now must rest a little to run the better and if we rest then the blind Knight is the time to do

          
          20:35:14
          so I said that it was a hard Choice said Aragon how shall we end this debate you are our guide said gimy and you are skilled in the chase you shall choose my heartbeat me go on said Legolas but we must hold together I will follow your counsel you give the choice to an ill choos said Aragon since we passed through the argonath my choices have gone a Miss he felt silent gazing north and west into the Gathering night for a long while we will not walk in the dark he said at length the Peril of missing the

          
          20:35:55
          trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater if the moon gave enough light we would use it but alas he sets early and is yet young and pale and tonight he is shrouded anyway gimy murmured would that the lady had given us a light such a gift as she gave to Frodo it will be more needed where it is bestowed said Aragon with him lies the true Quest ours is but a small matter in the great Deeds of this time a vain Pursuit from its beginning maybe which no choice of mine can Mar or mend well I

          
          20:36:33
          have chosen so let us use the time as best we may he cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep for he hadn't slept since their night under the shadow of tall brander Before Dawn was in the sky he woke and Rose gimy was still deep in Slumber but Legolas was standing gazing northwards into the darkness thoughtful and Silent as a young tree and a windless night they are far far away he said sadly turning to aror I know in my heart that they haven't rested this night only an eagle could

          
          20:37:13
          overtake them now nonetheless we will still follow as we may said Aragon stooping he roused the dwarf come we must go he said the scent is growing cold but it's still dark said gimy even legus on a Hilltop couldn't see them till the Sun is up I fear they have passed beyond my sight from Hill or plain under Moon or Sun said Legolas where sight fails the Earth may bring us rumor said Aragon the land must groan under their hated feet he stretched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf he

          
          20:37:54
          lay there motionless for so long a time that gimy wondered if he had swoed or fallen asleep again Dawn came glimmering and slowly a gray light grew about them at last he rose and now his friends could see his face it was pale and drawn and his look was troubled the rumor of the earth is dim and confused he said nothing walks upon it for many miles about us faint and far are the feet of our enemies but loud are the Hooves of the horses it comes to my mind that I heard them even as I lay on the ground in sleep and they troubled my

          
          20:38:33
          dreams horses galloping passing in the west but now they are drawing ever further from us riding northward I wonder what is happening in this land let us go said Legolas so the third day of their Pursuit began during all its long hours of cloud and fitful Sun they hardly paused now striding now running as if no weird could quench the fire that burned them they seldom spoke over the wide Solitude they passed and their Elven cloaks faded against the background of the gray green fields even in the cool sunlight of

          
          20:39:14
          midday few but Elvish eyes would have marked them until they were close at hand often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lauan for the gift of lmas for they could eat of it and find new Strength even as they ran all day the track of their enemies LED straight on going Northwest without a break or turn and as once again the day wore to its end they came to Long treeless slopes where the land rrose swelling up towards a line of low humpbacked Downs ahead the orc Trail grew fainter as it bent north towards

          
          20:39:53
          them for the ground became harder and the grass shorter far away to the left the river ENT wash wound a Silver Thread in a green floor no moving thing could be seen often AR G wondered that they saw no sign of Beast or man the dwellings of the rerum were for the most part many leagues away to the South under the wooded Eaves of the White Mountains Now hidden in mist and Cloud yet the horse Lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the East emnet this easterly region of their realm and there the herdsmen had wandered much

          
          20:40:33
          living in Camp and tent even in wintertime but now how all the land was empty and there was silence that did not seem to be the quiet of Peace at DUS they halted again now twice 12 leagues they had passed over the plains of Rohan and the wall of the EM wheel was lost in the shadows of the East the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky but it gave small light and the stars were veiled now do I most Grudge a time of rest or any halt in our Chase said Legolas the Orcs have run before us as if the very whips of sain were behind

          
          20:41:14
          them I fear they have already reached the forest and the dark Hills and even now are passing into the Shadows of the trees gimy ground his teeth this is a Bitter End to Our Hope and to all our toil he said to hope maybe but not to toil said Aragon we shall not turn back here yet I'm weary he gazed back along the way that they had come towards the night gathering in the East there is something strange at work in this land I distrust the silence I distrust even the pale moon the stars are faint and I'm weary as I have seldom

          
          20:41:53
          been before weary as no Ranger should be with a clear Trail to follow there is some will that lend speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us a weariness that is in the heart heart more than in the limb truly said Legolas that I have known since first we came down from the Emon wheel for the will is not behind us but before us he pointed away over the land of Rohan into the darkling West under the sickle Moon San muttered Aragon but he shall not turn us back halt we must once more for

          
          20:42:35
          see even the Moon is falling into Gathering Cloud but North lies our road between down and fin when day returns as before Legolas was first a foot if indeed he had ever slept awake awake he cried it is a Red Dawn strange things await Us by the eaves of the forest good or evil I do not know but we are cold awake the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again slowly the Downs Drew near it was still an hour before noon when they reached them green slopes rising to Bare ridges that ran in a line

          
          20:43:18
          straight towards the north at their feet the ground was dry and the turf short but a long strip of sunken land some 10 mil wide lay between them and the river wandering deep in dim thickets of Reed and rush just to the west of the southernmost slope there was a great Ring where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet from it the orc Trail ran out again turning North along the dry skirts of the hills Aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely they rested here a while he said

          
          20:43:56
          but even the outward Trail is already old I fear that your heart spoke truly legus it is Thrice 12 hours I guess since the Orcs stood where we now stand if they held to their Pace then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of fangor I can see nothing away North or west but grass dwindling into mist said gimy could we see the forest if we climbed the hills it's still far away said Aragon if I remember rightly these Downs run eight leagues or more to the North and then Northwest to the issuing of the ant wash

          
          20:44:34
          there lies still a wide land another 15 Lees it may be well let us go on said gimy my legs must forget the miles they would be more willing if my heart were less heavy the sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs for many hours they had marched without rest they were going slowly now and gim's back was bent ston hard other dwarves in labor or Journey but this endless Chase began to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart Aragorn walked behind him grim and Silent

          
          20:45:13
          stooping now and again to scan some print or Mark upon the ground only legus still stepped as lightly as ever his feet hardly seeming to press the grass leaving no footprint as he passed but in the waybread of the elves he found all the sustenance that he needed and he could sleep if sleep it could be called by men rest his mind in the strange Paths of Elish dreams even as he walked open eyed in the light of this world let us go up onto this Green Hill he said wearily they followed him climbing the long slope until they came

          
          20:45:53
          out upon the top it was a round hill smooth and bare standing by itself the most Northerly of the Downs the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain they were alone in a gray formless world without Mark or measure only far away Northwest there was a deeper Darkness against the dying light the mountains of mist and the forest at their feet nothing can we see to guide us here said gimy well now we must halt again and wear the night away it's growing cold the wind is north from the Snows

          
          20:46:34
          said Aragon and air more morning it will be in the East said Legolas but rest if you must yet do not cast all hope away tomorrow is unknown Reed of is found at the rising of the sun Three Sons already have risen on our Chase and brought no counsel said gimy the night grew ever colder Aragorn and gimy slept fitfully and whenever they awoke they saw legala standing beside them or walking to and fro singing softly to himself in his own tongue and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard Black Vault above so

          
          20:47:17
          the night passed together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky now bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came it was pale and clear the wind was in the East and all the Mists had rolled away wide lands lay Bleak about them in the bitter light ahead and Eastward they saw the windy Uplands of the world of Rohan that they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River northwestward stalked to the Dark Forest of fangor still 10 leagues away stood its shadowy Eaves and its further

          
          20:47:55
          slopes faded into the distant blue Beyond there glimmered far away as if floating on a gray cloud the white head of tall meadas the last peak of the mtic mountains out of the forest the anash flowed to meet them its stream now Swift and narrow and its banks deep clov the orc Trail turned from the Downs towards it following with his Keen eyes the trail to the river and then the river back towards the forest Aragon saw a shadow on the distant green a dark Swift moving blur he cast himself upon the

          
          20:48:35
          ground and listened again intent ly but legus Stood Beside him shading his bright Elven eyes with his long slender hand and he saw not a shadow nor a blur but the small figures of Horsemen many Horsemen and the glint of morning on the tips of their Spears was like the twinkle of minute Stars Beyond the Edge of mortal sight far behind them a dark smoke Rose in thin curling threads there was a silence in the empty fields and gimble could hear the air moving in the grass Riders cried Aragorn springing to

          
          20:49:15
          his feet many riders on Swift steeds are coming towards us yes said Legolas there are 105 yellow is their hair and bright are their Spears their leader is very tall Aragon smiled Keen are the eyes of the elves he said nay the ride is a little more than 5 leagues distant said legus five leagues or one said gimy we can't escape them in this bare land shall we wait for them here or go on our way we will wait said Aragon I am weary and our hunt has failed or at least others were before us for these Horsemen

          
          20:49:57
          are riding back down the orc Trail we may get news from them or spears said gimler there are three empty Saddles but I see no Hobbits said Legolas I didn't say that we should hear good news said Aragon but evil or good we'll await it here the three companions now left the hilltop where they might be an easy Mark against the pale sky and they walked slowly down the northward slope a little above the hills foot they Haled and wrapping their cloaks about them they sat huddled together upon the faded

          
          20:50:36
          grass the time passed slowly and heavily the wind was thin and searching gimy was uneasy what do you know of these Horsemen Aragorn he said do we sit here waiting for sudden death I've been among them answered Aragorn they are proud and willful but they are true-hearted generous in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise but unlearned writing no books but singing many songs after to the manner of the children of men before the dark years but I don't know what has happened here of late nor in what mind the rerum

          
          20:51:16
          may now be between the traitor San and the threat of saurin they have long been the friends of the people of Gondor though they are not akin to them it was in forgotten years long ago that AOL the young brought them out of the North and their kinship is rather with the Bings of Dale and with the beornings of the wood among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair as are the Riders of Rohan at least they'll not love the Orcs but Gandalf spoke of a rumor that they pay tribute to Mordor said gimy I

          
          20:51:54
          believe it no more than did Boromir answered Aragorn you will soon learn the truth said Legolas already they Approach at length even gimy could hear the distant beat of Galloping Hooves the horsemen following the trail had turned from the river and were Drawing Near the Downs they were riding like the wind now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields suddenly they swept up with a noise like Thunder and the foremost Horsemen swerved passing by the foot of the hill and leading the

          
          20:52:30
          host back Southward along the western skirts of the DS after him they rode a long long line of male clad men Swift shining fell and fair to look upon their horses were of great stature strong and clean limed their gray coats glistened their long tails flowed in the wind their mans were braided on their proud necks the men that drod them matched them well tall and long limed their hair flax and pale flowed under their light Helms and streamed in long braids behind them their faces were Stern and Keen in their hands were tall

          
          20:53:10
          Spears of Ash painted shields were slung at their backs long swords were at their belts their burnished skirts of male hung down upon their knees in pairs they galloped by and though every now and then one rose in his stups and gazed ahead and to either side they appeared not to perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them the host had almost passed when suddenly Aragon stood up and called in a loud voice what news from the north Riders of Rohan with astonishing speed and skill

          
          20:53:49
          they checked their steeds wheeled and came charging round soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of Horsemen moving in a running circle up the hill slope behind them and down round and round them and drawing ever inwards Aragorn stood silent and the other two sat without moving wondering what way things would turn without a word or cry suddenly the Riders halted a Thicket of Spears were pointed toward the strangers and some of the horsemen had bows in hand and their arrows were already fitted to the string

          
          20:54:27
          then one rode forward a tall man taller than all the rest from his Helm as a Crest a white horse tail flowed he adved bced until the point of his spear was within a foot of Aragon's breast Aragon did not stir who are you and what are you doing in this land said the rider using the common speech of the West in Manner and tone like the speech of bmir man of Gondor I am called Strider answered Aragon I came out of the North I am hunting Orcs the rider leapt from his horse giving his spear to another who rode up

          
          20:55:10
          and dismounted at his side he drew his sword and stood face to face with Aragorn surveying him keenly and not without Wonder at length he spoke again at first I thought that you yourselves were Orcs he said but now I see that it's not so indeed you know little Of Orcs if you go hunting them in this fashion they are Swift and well armed and they were many you would have changed from Hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken them but there's something strange about you Strider he bent his clear Bright Eyes

          
          20:55:47
          again upon the ranger that is no name for a man that you give and strange too is your reignment have you sprung out of the grass how did you escape our sight are you Elish folk no said Aragon one only of us is an elf Legolas from the Woodland realm in distant merkwood but we have passed through lloran and the gifts and favor of the lady go with us the rider looked at them with renewed Wonder but his eyes hardened then there is a lady in the golden Woods as old Tales tell he said for you escape her Nets they say these

          
          20:56:31
          are strange days but if you have her favor then you also are netw Weavers and Sorcerers maybe he turned a cold glance suddenly upon Legolas and gimy why do you not speak silent ones he demanded gimy Rose and planted his feet firmly apart his hand gripped the handle of his ax and his dark eyes flashed give me your name horse master and I will give you mine and more besides he said as for that said the the rider staring down at the dwarf The Stranger should declare himself first yet I am named AER son of aund and

          
          20:57:16
          I'm called the third Marshal of RAR then ammer son of aund third Marshal of ridar let gimbley the dwarf gloin son warn you against foolish words you speak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought and only little wit can excuse you am's eyes blazed and the men of Rowan murmured angrily and closed in advancing their Spears I would cut off your head beard at all master dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground said Elma he stands not alone said Legolas bending his bow and fitting an arrow with hands

          
          20:57:56
          that moved quicker than sight you would die before your stroke fell am raised his sword and things might have gone ill but Aragon sprang between the and raised his hand your pardon amama he cried when you know more you will understand why you have angered my companions we intend no evil to Rohan nor to any of its folk neither to man nor to horse will you not hear our tale before you strike I will said aom lowering his blade but wanders and the Ridder mark would be wise to be less hay in these days of doubt out first tell me your

          
          20:58:39
          right name first tell me whom you serve said Aragorn are you friend or Foe of saurin the dark lord of Mordor I serve only the lord of the mark Theoden king of thenal answered Amar we do not serve the power of the black land far away but neither are we yet at open war with him and if you are fleeing from him then you had best leave this land there is trouble now on all our borders and we are threatened but we desire only to be free and to live as we have lived keeping our own and serving no foreign

          
          20:59:18
          Lord good or evil we welcomed guests kindly in the better days but in these times The unbidden Stranger finds US Swift and hard come who are you whom do you serve at whose command do you hunt Orcs in our land I serve no man said Aragon but the Servants of sain I pursue into whatever land they may go there are few among mortal men who know more Of Orcs And I do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice the Orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends in such need a man that has no horse will go on foot

          
          21:00:00
          and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword I am not weaponless Aragon threw back his cloak the Elven sheath glittered as he grasped it and the bright blade of anduril shone like a Sut flame as he swept it out elendil he cried I am Aragorn son of arathor and I'm called elesa the elf Stone dadan the heir of isor alil son of Gondor here is the sword that was broken and his for again will you Aid me or thwart me choose swiftly gimly and Legolas looked at

          
          21:00:43
          their companion in amazement for they had not seen him in this mood before he seemed to have grown in stature while Amare had shrunk and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and Majesty of the kings of stone for a moment it seemed to the eye of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the Brows of Aragorn like a shining crown AMS stepped back and a look of awe was in his face he cast down his proud eyes these are indeed strange days he muttered dreams and legends spring to life out of the

          
          21:01:21
          grass tell me Lord he said what brings you here and what was the meaning of the dark words long has Boromir son of denior being gone seeking an answer and the horse that we lent him came back ride us what Doom do you bring out of the North the Doom of choice said Aragon you may say this to thean son of thel open wall lies before him with Sauron or against him none may live now as they have lived and few shall keep what they call their own but of these great matters we will speak later if chance ours I will come myself to the

          
          21:02:02
          king now I am in great need and I ask for help or at least for Tidings you heard that we pursuing an or Coast that carried off our friends what can you tell us that you need not pursue them further said aom the Orcs are destroyed and our friends we found none but ORS but that is strange indeed said Aragorn did you search the slain were there no bodies other than those of orc kind they would be small only children to your eyes unshod but clad in Gray there were no dwarves nor children said aom we counted all the slain and

          
          21:02:46
          despoiled them and then we piled the carcasses and burned them as is our custom the ashes are smoking still we do not speak of dwarves or children said gimy our friends were Hobbits Hobbits said Elma and what may they be it is a strange name name a strange name for a strange folk said gimy but these were very dear to us it seems that you have heard in Rohan of the words that troubled minth they spoke of the halfling these Hobbits are halflings halflings laughed the rider that Stood Beside air halflings but they

          
          21:03:28
          are only a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the North do we walk in Legends or on the Green Earth the daylight a man may do both said Aragorn for not we but those who come after will make the legends of our time the green earth say you that is a mighty matter of Legend though you tread it under the light of day time is pressing said the rider not heeding Aragorn we must hasten South Lord let us leave these wild folk to their fances or let us bind them and take them to the king peace aine said a in his own tongue

          
          21:04:13
          leave me a while tell they a ordered to assemble on the path and make ready to ride to the ENT Wade muttering aoine retired and spoke to the others soon they drew off and left aare alone with the three companions all that you say is strange jaragon he said yet you speak the truth that is plain the men of the mark do not lie and therefore they are not easily deceived but you have not told all will you not now speak more fully of your errand so that I may judge what to do I set out from imladris as it is

          
          21:04:57
          named in the rhyme many weeks ago answered Aragon with me went Boromir of minth my errand was to go to the that city with the son of denior to Aid his folk in their war against saurin but the company that I journeyed with had other business of that I cannot speak now Gandalf the Grey was our leader Gandalf aare exclaimed Gandalf grahame is known in the mark but his name I warn you is no longer a password to the king's favor he has been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men coming as he will after a season or

          
          21:05:37
          after many years he is ever The Herald of strange events a bringer of evil some now say indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone a Miss at that time our trouble with Saran began until then we counted Saran our friend but Gandalf came then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in Eisen guard he said that he himself had been a prisoner in oron and had hardly escaped and he begged for help but theodan would not listen to him and he went away speak not the name of Gandalf loudly in

          
          21:06:17
          theoden's ears he is wroth for Gandalf took the horse that is called shadowax the most precious of all the king's steeds chief of the mayus which only the lord of the Mark May ride for the S of their race was the great horse of a that knew the speech of men seven nights ago shadowx returned but the king's anger is not less for now the horse is wild and will let no man handle him then shadowfax has found his way alone from the far north said Aragon for it was there that he and Gandalf parted but alas Gandalf will ride no longer he

          
          21:07:00
          fell into darkness in the minds of Moria and comes not again that is is heavy Tidings said herma at least to me and to many though not to all as you may find if you come to the king it is Tidings more Grievous than any in this land can understand though it might touch them solely a the year is much older said Aragon but when the Great Fall the less must lead my part it has been to guide our company on the long road from Moria through laurian we came of which it were well that you should learn the truth a

          
          21:07:39
          you speak of it again and then down the leagues of the Great River to the Falls of Rus their bomir was slain by the same Orcs whom you destroyed your news is all of Woe cried amama in dismay great harm is this death to Min tith and to us all that was a worthy man all spoke his praise he came seldom to the mark for he was ever in the war on the East borders but I've seen him more like to the Swift sons of AOL than to the Grave men of Gondor he seemed to me and liked it to prove a great captain of his people when his

          
          21:08:17
          time came but we've had no word of this grief out of Gondor when did he fall it is now the fourth day since he was slain answered Aragorn and since the evening of that day we've journeyed from the shadow of TL brandia on foot cried amama yes even as you see us wide Wonder came into am's eyes Strider is too poor a name son of Aron he said wing foot I name you this deed of three friends shall be sung in many a hall 40 leagues and five you have measured a the fourth day is ended Hardy is the race of

          
          21:09:02
          alel but now Lord what would you have have me do I must return in haste to theodan I spoke wearily before my men it's true that when're not yet at open war with a black land and there are some close to the king's ear that speak Craven counsels but war is coming we shall not forsake our old alliance with Gondor and while they fight we shall Aid them so say I and all who hold with me the East Mark is my charge the ward of the third Marshall and I've removed all our herds and herd folk withdrawing them Beyond endash and

          
          21:09:42
          leaving none here but guards and Swift Scouts then you don't pay tribute to Sauron said gimy we do not and we never have said aare with a flash of his eyes though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told some years ago the lord of the black land wished to purchase horses of us at great price but we refused him for he puts beasts to evil use then he sent plundering Orcs And they carry off what they can choosing always the black horses few of these are now left for that reason our Feud with

          
          21:10:22
          the Orcs is bitter but at this time our chief concern is with Saron he's claimed lordship over all this land and there has been war between us for many months he has taken Orcs into his service and Wolf Riders and evil men and he has closed the Gap against us so that we are likely to be beset both East and West it's ill dealing with such a foe he is a wizard both cunning and dmer crafty having many Gees he walks here and there they say as an old man hooded and cloaked very like to Gandalf as many now

          
          21:10:59
          recall his spies slip through every net and his birds of ill Omen are abroad in the sky I don't know how it will all end and my heart misgives me for it seems to me that his friends don't all dwell in Eisen guard but if you come to the King's house you shall see for yourself will you not come do I hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need I will come when I may said Aragon come now said air the heir of a lendel would be a strength indeed to the sons of AOL in this evil

          
          21:11:39
          tide there is Battle even now upon the west emnet and I fear that it may go ill for us indeed in this riding north I went without the king's leave for in my absence his house is left with little guard but Scouts warned me of the or Coast coming down out of the East wall three nights ago and among them they reported that some bore the White badges of suron so suspecting what I most fear a league between orank and The Dark Tower I led forth my aorded men of my own household and we overtook the Orcs at nightfall

          
          21:12:18
          two days ago near to the borders of the entwood there we surrounded them and gave battle yesterday at dawn 15 of my men I lost and 12 horses Al L for the Orcs were greater in number than we counted on others joined the coming out of the east across the Great River their Trail is plain to see a little north of this spot and others too came out of the forest great Orcs who also bore the White Hand of Eisen guard that kind is stronger and more fill than all the others nonetheless we put an end to them

          
          21:12:56
          but we have been too long away we are needed South and West will you not come there are spare horses as you see there is work for the sword to do yes and we could find a use for gim's a and the bow of legalis if they will pardon my rash words concerning the lady of the wood I spoke only as do all men in my land and I would gladly learn better I thank you for your fair words said Aragon and my heart desires to come with you but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains hope does not remain said

          
          21:13:36
          you will not find your friends on the North borders yet my friends are not behind we found a clear token not far from the East wall that one at least of them was still alive there but between the wall and the downs we found no other trace of them and no Trail has turned aside this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me then what do you think is become of them I don't know they may have been slain and burned among the Orcs but that you will say can't be and I don't fear it I can only think that they

          
          21:14:12
          were carried off into the forest before the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe can you swear that none escaped your net in such a way I would swear that no orc escaped after we cited them said Amma we reached the forest EES before them and if after that any living thing broke through our ring then it was no orc and had some Elish power our friends were at tired even as we were said Aragorn and you passed us by Under the full light of day I'd forgotten that said Amma it's hard to be sure of

          
          21:14:50
          anything among so many marbles the world is all grown strange elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fields and folks speak with the lady of the wood and yet live and the sword comes back back to war that was broken in the long ages a the fathers of our fathers rode into the mark how shall a man judge what to do in such times as he ever has judged said Aragon good and Ill have not changed since yester year nor are they one thing among elves and dwarves and another among men it's a man's part to discern them as

          
          21:15:29
          much in the golden wood as in his own house true indeed said air but I don't doubt you nor the deed which my heart would do yet I'm not free to do all as I would it's against our law to let strangers wander at will in our land until the king himself shall give them leave and more strict is the command in these days of peril I begged you to come back willingly with me and you won't loath am I to begin a battle of 100 against three I don't think your law was made paid for such a chance said Aragorn nor

          
          21:16:08
          indeed am I a stranger for I've been in this land before more than once and ridden with the host of the roim though under other name and in other guise you I haven't seen before for you were young but I have spoken with aund your father and with thean son of thle never in former days would any High Lord of this land have constrained a man to abandon on such a quest as mine my duty at least is clear to go on come now son of amond the choice must be made at last Aid us or at the worst let us go free or seek to carry out your law

          
          21:16:52
          if you do so there will be fewer to return to your war or to your king aomar was silent for a moment then he spoke we both have need of haste he said my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your hope this is my choice you may go and what is more I will lend you horses this only I ask when your quest is achieved or is proved vain return with the horses over the ENT Wade to medel the High House in edus where theodan now sits thus you shall prove to him that I have not misjudged in this I place myself and maybe my very

          
          21:17:38
          life in the keeping of your good faith don't fail I will not said Aragon there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful glances among his men when aare gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to The Strangers but only aoine dared to speak openly it may be well enough for this lord of the race of Gondor as he claims he said but who has heard of a horse of the mark being given to a dwarf no one said gimy and do not trouble no one will ever hear of it I would sooner walk than sit on the back of any Beast so great

          
          21:18:21
          free or begrudged but you must ride now or you will hinder us said Aragon come you shall sit behind me friend gimy said Legolas then all will be well and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one a great dark gray horse was brought to Aragon and he mounted it huel is his name said Emma May he bear you well and a better Fortune than Gulf his late Master a smaller and lighter horse but restive and fiery was brought to legalis arod was his name but Legolas asked them to take off sadl and rain I need them

          
          21:19:06
          not he said and leapt lightly up and to their Wonder arod was tame and willing beneath him moving here and there with but a spoken word such was the Elish way with all good beasts gimy was lifted up behind his friend and he clung to him not much more at ease than Sam gamji in the boat farewell and may you find what you seek said Elma return with what speed you may and let our swords here after to shine together I will come said Aragon and I will come too said gimy the matter of the lady gadriel lies between us I have

          
          21:19:47
          yet to teach you Gentle speech we shall see said Amma so many strange things have chanced that to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving Strokes of a dwarf's ex will seem no great Wonder farewell with that they parted very Swift were the horses of Rohan when after a little gimy looked back the company of Arma were already small and Far Away Adon did not look back he was watching the trail as they sped on their way bending low with his head beside the neck of Hell before long they came to the borders of

          
          21:20:27
          the anash and there they met the other trail of which AA spoke coming down from the East out of the world Aragon dismounted and surveyed the ground then leaping back into the saddle he rode away for some distance Eastward keeping to one side and taking care not to override the footprints then he again dismounted and examined the ground going backwards and forwards on foot there's little to discover he said when he returned the main trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back

          
          21:21:05
          their outward course must have Lin near to the river but this Eastward Trail is fresh and clear there's no sign there of any feet going the other way back towards andwin now we must ride slower and make sure that no trace or footstep branches off on either side the Orcs Must Have Been aware from this point that they were pursued they may have made some attempt to get their captives away before they were overtaken as they rode forward the day was overcast low gray clouds came over the world a Mist shrouded the sun ever

          
          21:21:44
          nearer the tree clad slopes of fangorn loomed slowly darkling as the sun went West they saw no sign of Any Trail to right or left but here and there they passed single Orcs fallen in their tracks as they ran with gray feathered arrows sticking in back or throat at last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest and in an open Glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning the ashes were still hot and smoking beside it was a great pile of Helms and mail cloven Shields and

          
          21:22:22
          broken swords bows and darts and other gear of War upon a stake in the middle was set a great Goblin head upon its shattered Helm the white badge could still be seen further away not far from the river where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood there was a mound it was newly raised the raw Earth was covered with fresh cut turves about it were planted 15 Spears Aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle but the light faded and evening soon grew down dim and Misty by

          
          21:23:03
          Nightfall they had discovered no trace of Med and Pippen we can do no more said gimy sadly we've been set many riddles since we came to tall brere but this is the hardest to unravel I would guess that the burned bones of their Hobbits are now mingled with the Orcs it'll be hard news for Frodo if he lives to hear it and hard too for the old Hobbit who waits in rivendel elron was against their coming but Gandalf was not said Legolas but Gandalf chose to come himself and he was the first to be lost

          
          21:23:41
          answered gimy his foresight failed him the Council of Gandalf was not founded on for knowledge of safety for himself or for others said Aragon there are some things that it's better to begin than to refuse even though the end may be dark but I shall not depart from this place yet in any case we must here await at the Morning Light a little Way Beyond the battlefield they made their Camp under a spreading tree it looked like a Chestnut and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of a former year like dry hands

          
          21:24:20
          with long sped fingers they rattled mournfully in the night Breeze gimly shivered they had brought only one blanket a piece let's light a fire he said I care no longer for the danger let the Orcs come as thick as summer moths round a candle if those unhappy Hobbits are astray in the woods it might draw them hither said Legolas and it might draw other things neither orc nor Hobbit said Aragorn we are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saaman and also we're on the very edge of fangor and it's perilous to

          
          21:24:59
          touch the Trees of that wood it is said but the RO here made a great burning here yesterday said gim and they filed trees for the far as can be seen yet they passed the night away safely here when their labor was ended there were many said Aragorn and they don't heed the Roth of fangor for they come here seldom and they don't go under the trees but our paths are likely to lead us into the very Forest itself so have a care cut no Living Wood there's no need said gim the Riders have left chip and bow enough

          
          21:25:37
          and there's dead wood lying in plenty he went off to gather Fuel and busied himself with building and kindling a far but Aragorn sat silently with his back to the great tree deep in thought and legus stood alone in the open looking towards the profound shadow of the wood leaning forward as one who listens to voices calling from a distance when the dwarf had a small bright Blaze going the three companions Drew close to it and sat together shrouding the light with their wooded forms Legolas looked up at the bows of

          
          21:26:12
          the tree reaching out above them look he said the tree is glad of the fire it may have been that the dancing Shadows tricked their eyes but certainly to each of the companions the bows appeared to be bending this way and that so as to come above the Flames while the upper branches were stooping down the brown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown Forest so near at hand made itself felt as a great

          
          21:26:50
          brooding presence full of secret purpose after a while Legolas spoke again kabor warned us not to go far into fangor he said do you know why Aragorn what are the fables of the forest that Boromir had heard I've heard many tales in Gondor and elsewhere said Aragorn but if it weren't for the words of kellor I should deem them only fables that men have made as true knowledge Fades I thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter and if an elf of the wood doesn't know how shall a man answer you've journeyed further than I

          
          21:27:32
          said Legolas I've heard nothing of this in my own land save only songs that tell how the onod the men called an dwelt there long ago but fangor is old old even as the elves would reckon it yes it's old said Aragon as old is the forest by the barow downs and it's far greater elron says that the two are Ain the last strongholds of the mighty Woods of the Elder days in which the firstborn roamed while men still slept but fangor holds some secret of its own what it is I don't know I don't wish to know said gimy let

          
          21:28:14
          nothing that dwells in fangor be troubled on my account they now Drew lots for the watches and the lot for the first watch fell to gimy the others lay down almost at once sleep laid hold on them gimle said Aragon drowsily remember it's perilous to cut bow or twig from a living tree in fangorn but Don't Stray far in search of dead wood Let the Fire Die rather call me at need with that he fell asleep legus already lay motionless his fair hands folded upon his breast his eyes unclosed blending living night and

          
          21:28:57
          deep dream as is the way with elves gimy sat hunched by the fire running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe the tree rustled there was no other sound suddenly gimy looked up and there just on the edge of the Fire Light stood an old bent man leaning on a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes gimly sprang up too amazed for the moment to cry out though at once the thought flashed into his mind that San had caught them both arag and Legolas

          
          21:29:35
          aroused by his sudden movement sat up and stared the old man didn't speak or make a sign well father what can we do for you said Aragon leaping to his feet come and be warm if you're cold he stroe forward but the old man was gone there was no trace of him to be found near at hand and they didn't dare to wander far the moon had set and the night was very dark suddenly Legolas gave a cry the horse horses the horses the horses were gone they dragged their pickets and disappeared for some time the three

          
          21:30:12
          companions Stood Still and Silent troubled by this new stroke of ill Fortune they were under the eaves of fangor and endless leagues lay between them and the men of Rohan their only friends in this wide and dangerous land as they stood it seemed to them that they heard far off in the night the sound of horses winning and nighing then all was quiet again except for the cold rustle of the wind well they're gone said Aragon at last we can't find them or catch them so that if they don't return of their own

          
          21:30:48
          free will we must do without we started on our own feet and we have those still feet said gimy but we can't eat them as well as walk on them he threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of Rohan laughed legalis but you'll make a ride yet it seems unlikely that I shall have the chance said gimler if you wish to know what I think he began again after a while I think it was San who else remember the words of ammer he walks about like an old man hooded and cloaked

          
          21:31:31
          those were the words he's gone off with our horse or scared them away and here we are there's more trouble coming to us mark my words I mark them said aror but I marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood still I don't doubt that you guess right and that we're in Peril here by night or day yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest while we may I'll watch for a while now gimy I've more need of thought than of sleep the night passed slowly legalis followed Aragon and gimy followed legalis and

          
          21:32:10
          their watches wore away but nothing happened the old man didn't appear again and the horses did not return Chapter 3 The urai Pippen lay in a dark and troubled dream it seemed that he could hear his own Small Voice echoing in Black tunnels calling Frodo Frodo but instead of Frodo hundreds of hideous orc faces grinned at him out of the Shadows hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side where was Mary he woke cold air blew on his face he was lying on his back evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim

          
          21:33:04
          he turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking his wrists legs and ankles were tied with cords beside him meray white-faced with a dirty rag bound across his brows all about them sat or stood a great company Of Orcs slowly in Pippen's aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream Shadows of course he and Mary had run off into the woods what had come over them why had they dashed off like that taking no notice of old Strider they'd run a long way shouting

          
          21:33:43
          he couldn't remember how far or how long and then suddenly they'd crashed right into a group of Orcs they were standing listening and they didn't appear to see Mary and Pippen until they were almost in their arms then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees Mary and he had drawn their swords but the Orcs didn't wish to fight and had tried only to lay hold of them even when Mary had cut off several of their arms and hands good old Mary then Boromir had come leaping through the trees he had made them fight

          
          21:34:19
          he slew many of them and the rest fled but they hadn't gone far on the way back when they're attacked Again by a 100 Orcs at least some of them very large and they shot a rain of arrows always at bmir BM had blown his Great Horn till the woods rang and at first the Orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back but when no answer but the Echoes came they'd attacked more fiercely than ever Pippen didn't remember much more his last memory was of Boromir leaning against the tree plucking out an arrow then Darkness fell

          
          21:34:56
          suddenly I suppose I was knocked on the head he said to himself I wonder if poor Mary is much hurt what has happened to bmir why didn't the Orcs kill us where are we and where are we going he couldn't answer the questions he felt cold and sick I wish Gandalf had never persuaded elron to let us come he thought what good have I been just a nuisance a passenger a piece of luggage and now I've been stolen and I'm just a piece of luggage for the Orcs I hope Strider are some will come and claim us but ought I to hope for it won't that

          
          21:35:38
          throw out all the plans I wish I could get free he struggled a little quite uselessly one of the orc sitting there laughed and said something to a companion in that abominable tongue rest while you can Little Fool he said then to Pippen in the common speech which he made almost as hideous as his own own language rest while you can we'll find a use for your legs before long you'll wish should got none before we get home if I had my way you'd wish you were dead now said the other I'll make you squeak you miserable rat he stooped over

          
          21:36:24
          Pippen bringing his yellow fangs close to his face he had a black knife with a long Jagged blade in his hand lie quiet or I'll tickle you with this he hissed don't draw attention to yourself or I may forget my orders curse the ice and guarders a b push Sky he passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling terrified Pippen lay still though the pain at his wrists and ankles was growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back to take his

          
          21:37:08
          mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear there were many voices around him and though orc speech sounded at all times full of hate and anger it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter to Pippin's surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible many of the Orcs were using ordinary language apparently the members of two or three quite different tribes were present and they couldn't understand one another's orc speech there was an angry debate

          
          21:37:41
          concerning what they were to do now which way they were to take and what should be done with the prisoners there's no time to kill them properly said one no time for play on this trip that can't be helped said another but why not kill them quick kill them now they're a cursed nuisance and we're in a hurry evening's coming on and we ought to get a move on orders said a third voice and a deep growl kill all but not the halflings they to be brought back a dive as quickly as possible that's my orders what have they wanted for asked

          
          21:38:25
          several voices why alive do they give support no I heard that one of them has got something something that's wanted for the war some Elvish PL or other anyway they'll both be questioned is that all you know why don't we search them and find out we might find something that we could use ourselves that is a very interesting remark sneered a voice softer than the others but more evil I may have to report that the prisoners are not to be searched or plundered those are my orders and mine too said the deep voice alive

          
          21:39:09
          and as captured no spoiling that's my orders not our orders said one of the earlier voices we've come all the way from the mines to kill and avenge our folk I wish to kill and then go back North and you can wish again said the growling voice I am ugluk I command I return to eard by the shortest road is sand the master of the great eye said the evil voice we should go back at once to L B if we could cross the Great River we might said another voice but there aren't enough of us to venture down to

          
          21:39:55
          the bridges I came across said the evil voice a winged nasgul awaits us northward on the East Bank maybe maybe then you'll fly off with our prisoners and get all the pay and praise in lug BOS and leave us to footed as best we can through the horse country no we must stick together these lands are dangerous full of foul Rebels and bgins I we must stick together growled UK I don't trust you little swine you've no guts outside your own sty but for us you'd all have run away we are fighting urai we slew the great warrior we took

          
          21:40:39
          the prisoners we are the Servants of seron the wise the white hand the hand that gives us man's flesh to eat we came out of Eis andard and led you here and we shall Lead You Back by the way we choose I am ugluk I have spoken you have spoken more than enough UK Sneed the evil voice I wonder how they would like it in L Bor they might think that ugl's shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head they might ask where his strange ideas came from did they come from seron perhaps who does he think he is sitting up on his

          
          21:41:21
          own with his filthy White badges they might agree with me with Gnar their trusted messenger and I gar say this San is a fool and a treacherous fool but the great eye is on him swine is it how do you folk like being called swine by the mck rakers of a dirty little wizard it's orc flesh they eat I'll warrant many loud yells in orc speech answered him and the ringing Clash of weapons being drawn cautiously Pippen rolled over hoping to see what would happen his guards had gone to join in the fry in the Twilight he saw a large

          
          21:42:07
          black orc probably orluk standing facing grishnak a short crook legged creature very Broad and with long arms that hung almost to the Ground Round them were many smaller goblins Pippen supposed that these were the ones from the north they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated to attack UK UK shouted and a number of other orc of nearly his own size ran up then suddenly without warning orluk sprang forwards and with two Swift Strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents Gish stepped aside and vanished into the

          
          21:42:47
          Shadows the others gave way and one stepped backwards and fell over Mar's prostrate form with a curse yet that probably saved his life for auk's followers leapt over him and cut down another with a broad bladed swords it was the Yellow fanged Guard his body fell right on top of Pippen still clutching its long sore edged knife put up your weapons shouted oguk and let's have no more nonsense we go straight west from here and down the stair from there straight to the Downs then along the river to the forest and

          
          21:43:27
          we March day and night that clear now thought Pippen if only a takes that ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under control I've got a chance a gleam of Hope had come to him the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm and then slid down to his wrist he felt the blood trickling onto his hand but he also felt the cold Touch of Steel against his skin the Orcs were getting ready to March again but some of the Northerners were still unwilling and the Eis and guarders slew two more before the rest

          
          21:44:02
          were cow there was much cursing and confusion for the moment Pippin was unwatched his legs were securely bound but his arms were only tied about the wrists and his hands were in front of him he could move them both together though the bonds were cruy tight he pushed the dead Oak to one side then hardly daring to breathe he drew the knot of the wrist cord up and down against the blade of the knife it was sharp and the dead hand held it fast the cord was cut quickly Pippen took it in his fingers and knotted it again into

          
          21:44:39
          a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands then he lay very still pick up those prisoners shouted ugluk don't play any tricks with them if they're not alive when we get back someone else will die too an orc seized Pippen like a sack put put its head between his tied hands grabbed his arms and dragged them down until Pippin's face was crushed against its neck then it jolted off with him another treated Med in the same way the orc's claw-like hand gripped Pippin's arms like iron the nails bit into him he

          
          21:45:23
          shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams suddenly he was thrown onto the Stony floor again it was early night but the slim moon was already falling Westward they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale Mist there was a sound of water falling nearby the Scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand well what did you discover growled the voice of ugluk only a single Horseman and he made off Westward all's clear now now I dare say but how long you fools you should

          
          21:46:03
          have sh him he raised the alarm the cursed horse breeders will hear of us by morning now we'll have to leg it double quick a shadow bent over Pippen it was aook sit up said the orc my Lads are tired of lugging you about we've got to climb down and you must use your legs be careful now no crying out no trying to escape we have ways of paying for tricks that you won't like though they won't spoil your usefulness for the master he cut the thongs around Pippin's legs and ankles picked him up by his

          
          21:46:42
          hair and stood him on his feet Pippin fell down andlook dragged him up by his hair again several Orcs laughed orluk thrust a flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat he felt a hot Fierce glow flow through him the pain in his legs and ankles vanished he could stand and now for the other said ugluk Pippen saw him go to Mary who was lying close by and kick him medy groaned seizing him roughly ugluk pulled him into a sitting position and tore the bandage off his head then he smeared the

          
          21:47:22
          wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box Mary cried out and struggled wildly the Orcs capped and hooted can't take his medicine they Jared doesn't know what's good for him I we shall have some fun later but at the moment UK wasn't engaged in sport he needed speed and had to humor unwilling followers he was healing marry and orc fashion and his treatment worked swiftly when he'd forced a drink from his flask down the hobbit's throat cut his leg bonds and dragged him to his feet Med stood up

          
          21:48:00
          looked pale but grim and defiant and very much alive the gash in his fored gave him no more trouble but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days hello Pippen he said so you've come on this little Expedition too where do we get bed and breakfast now then said aook none of that hold your tongues no talk to one another any trouble will be reported at the other end and he'll know how to pay you you'll get bed and breakfast all right more than you can stomach the orc band began to descend a narrow Ravine leading down into the

          
          21:48:40
          Misty plane below medy and Pippen separated by a dozen Orcs or more climbed down with them at the bottom they stepped onto grass and the hearts of the hobbits Rose now straight on shouted ugluk West and a little North follow Lush but what are we going to do at sunrise said some of the Northerners go on running said auk what do you think sit on the grass and wait for the white skins to join the picnic but we can't run in the sunlight you'll run with me behind you said UK run or you'll never see your

          
          21:49:21
          beloved holes again by the White Hand what's the use of sending out Mountain maggots on a trip only half trained run curse you run while night lasts then the whole company began to run with a long loping strides Of Orcs they kept no order thrusting jostling and cursing yet their speed was very great each Hobbit had a guard of three Pippen was far back in the line he wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace he had had no food since the morning one of his guards had a whip but at present the

          
          21:49:59
          orc liquor was still hot in him his wits too were Wide Awake every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the Keen face of Strider bending over a dark Trail and running running behind but what could even a ranger see except a confused trail of orc feet his own little prince and Mees were overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron shod shoes before them and behind them and about them they had gone only a mile or so from The Cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow depression where the

          
          21:50:35
          ground was soft and wet Mist lay there pale glimmering in the last rays of the sickle Moon the dark shapes of the Orcs in front grew dim and then were swallowed up I steady now shouted auk from the rear a sudden thought leapt into Pippen's mind and he acted on it at once he swerved aside to the right and dived out of the reach of his clutching guard head first into into the Mist he landed sprawling on the grass halt yell grook there was for a moment turmoil and confusion Pippen sprang up and ran but

          
          21:51:14
          the Orcs were after him some suddenly loomed up right in front of him no hope of Escape thought Pippen but there is a hope that I've left some of my own marks unspoiled on the wet ground he groped with his two tied hands at his throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak as long arms and hard claws seized him he let it fall there I suppose it'll lie until the end of time he thought I don't know why I did it if the others have escaped they've probably all gone with Frodo a whip thong curled around his

          
          21:51:48
          legs and he stifled a cry enough shouted UK running up he's still got to run a long way yet make them both run just use the whip as a reminder but that's not all he snarled turning to Pippen I Shan forget payment is only put off leg it neither Pippin nor Mary remembered much of the later part of the journey evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery with hope growing ever fainter behind they ran and they ran striving to keep up the pace set by the Orcs licked every now and again with a cruel thong

          
          21:52:31
          cunningly handled if they they halted or stumbled they were seized and dragged for some distance the warmth of the orc draft had gone Pippen felt cold and sick again suddenly he fell face downward on the turf hard hands with rening nails gripped and lifted him he was carried like a sack once more and darkness grew about him whether the darkness of another night or a blindness of his eyes he couldn't tell dimly he became aware of voes Cl ing it seemed that many of the Orcs were demanding a halt UK was shouting he felt

          
          21:53:09
          himself flung to the ground and he lay as he fell till black dreams took him but he didn't long Escape From Pain soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him again for a long time he was tossed and shaken and then slowly the darkness gave way and he came back to the waking world and found that it was morning orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass there he lay for a while fighting with despair his head swam but from the heat in his body he guessed that he'd been given another draft an orc stooped

          
          21:53:46
          over him and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried flesh he ate the stale bread hungrily but not the meat he was famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an orc the flesh if he dared not guess what creature he sat up and looked about M was not far away they were by the banks of a swift narrow River ahead mountains loomed a tall Peak was catching the first rays of the Sun a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them there was much shouting and debating among the Orcs a quarrel seemed

          
          21:54:26
          on the point of breaking out again between the Northerners and the Eisen guarders some were pointing back away South and some were pointing Eastward very well said oguk leave them to me then no killing as I've told you before but if you want to throw away what we've come all the way to get throw it away I look after it let the fighting urai do the work as usual if you're afraid of the white skins run run there's the forest he shouted pointing ahead get to it it's your best hope off you go and quick before I knock a few more heads

          
          21:55:04
          off to put some sense into the others there was some cursing and scuffling and then most of the Northerners broke away and dashed off over a hundred of them running wildly along the river towards the mountains the hbits were left for the Eis and guarders a grim dark band four score at least of large swart slant eyed Orcs with great bows and short broad blad swords a few of the larger and Bolder Northerners remained with them now we'll deal with Gnar said auk but some even of his own followers were

          
          21:55:39
          looking uneasily southwards I know growled ugluk the cursed horse boys have got wind of us but that's all your fault snug you and the other Scouts ought to have your ears cut off but we're the fighters we'll Feast on horse flesh yet or something better at that moment Pippen saw why some of the troop had been pointing Eastward from that direction there now came horse cries and there was Gish AR again and at his back a couple of score of others like him long armed crooked leg Orcs they had a red eye painted on

          
          21:56:17
          their Shields orluk stepped forward to meet them so you've come back he said thought better of it eh I've return to see that orders are carried out and the Prisoner safe answered ginar in indeed said oflook waste of effort I'll see that orders are carried out in my command and what else did you come back for you went in a hurry did you leave anything behind I left a fool snarled gnak but there were some start Fells with him and they're too good to lose I knew you'd lead them into a mess I've come to help them Splendid laughed a

          
          21:56:59
          Gluk but unless you've got some guts for fighting you've taken the wrong way L BS was your road the white Skins are coming what's happened to your precious narou as he had another Mount shot under him now if you've brought him along that might have been useful if these nasal are all they make out nasal nasgul shouted Gnar shivering and licking his lips as if the word had a foul taste that he savored painfully you speak of what is deep being be on the reach of your muddy dreams who look he said Nas G

          
          21:57:38
          ah all that they make out one day you'll wish that you hadn't said that ape he snarled fiercely you ought to know that they're the apple of the great eye but the winged nasal not yet not yet he won't let them show themselves across the Great River yet not too soon there for the war and other purposes you seem to know a lot said UK more than is good for you I guess perhaps those in L B might wonder how and why but in the meantime the orai of iard can do the dirty work as usual don't stand slaving there get your Rebel

          
          21:58:23
          together the other swine are legging it to the forest you'd better follow you wouldn't get back to the Great River alive right off the mark now I'll be on your heels the Eisen guarders seized medy and Pippen again and slung them on their backs then the troop started off hour after hour they ran pausing now and again only to sling the Hobbits to Fresh carriers either because they were quicker and harder or because of some plan of gnars the eyes and guarders gradually passed through the Orcs of Mordor and gnar's folk closed in behind

          
          21:59:03
          soon they were gaining also on the Northerners ahead the forest began to draw nearer Pippin was bruised and torn his aching head was grated by the filthy jow and hairy ear of the orc that held him immediately in front were bowed backs and tough thick legs going up and down up and down unresting as if they were made of wire and Horn beating out the nightmare seconds of an endless time in the afternoon UK troop overtook the Northerners they were flagging in the Rays of the bright Sun winter sun shining in a pale cool Sky though it was

          
          21:59:42
          their heads were down and their tongues lulling out maggots Jered the E and guarders you're cooked the white skins will catch you and eat you they're coming a cry from grishnak showed that this was not mere Gest Horsemen riding very swiftly had indeed been sighted still far behind but gaining on the Orcs gaining on them like a tide over the Flats on folk straying in quicksand the E and guarders began to run with the redoubled pace that astonished pipin a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race then he saw

          
          22:00:21
          that the sun was sinking falling behind the Misty Mountains Shadows reached over the land the soldiers of Mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed the forest was dark and close already they had passed a few outlying trees the land was beginning to slope upwards ever more steeply but the Orcs didn't halt both ugluk and grishnak shouted spurning them on to a last effort they'll make it yet they'll Escape thought Pippen and then he managed to twist his neck so as to glance back with one eye over his

          
          22:00:59
          shoulder he saw that Riders away Eastward were already level with the Orcs Galloping over the plain the sunset gilded their Spears and helmets and glinted in their pale flowing hair they were Heming the Orcs in preventing them from scattering and driving them along over the line of the river he wondered very much what kind of folk they were he wished now that he had learned more in rivendel and looked more at maps and things but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands and he'd never reckoned

          
          22:01:34
          with being cut off from gandal or from Strider and even from Frodo all that he could remember about Rowan was that Gandalf's horse shadowfax had come from that land that sounded hopeful as far as it went but how will they know that we're not Orcs he thought I don't suppose they've ever heard of Hobbits down here I suppose I ought to be glad that the beastly Orcs look like being destroyed but I'd rather be saved myself the chances were that he and Mery would be killed together with their captors

          
          22:02:08
          before even the men of Rohan were aware of them a few of the Riders appeared to be Bowman skilled at shooting from a running horse riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the Orcs that straggled behind and several of them fell then the Riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering bows of their enemies who shot wildly not daring to talk this happened many times and on one occasion arrows fell among the Eisen guarders one of them just in front of Pippin stumbled and did not get up again night came down without the Riders

          
          22:02:45
          closing in for battle many Orcs had fallen but fully 200 remained in the early Darkness the Orcs came to a hilic the eaves of the forests were very near probably no more than three furlongs away but they could go no further the horsemen had encircled them a small band disobeyed UK's command and ran on towards the forest only three returned well here we are sneered krishnar fine leadership I hope the great ugluk will lead us out again put those halflings down ordered ugluk taking no notice of Gnar you lugou get

          
          22:03:29
          two others and stand guard over them they're not to be killed unless the filthy white skins break through understand as long as I'm alive I want them but they're not to cry out and they're not to be rescued find their legs the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly but Pippin found that for the first time he was close to Mary the Orcs were making a great deal of noise shouting and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while I don't think much of this said Mary I

          
          22:04:05
          feel nearly done in don't think I could crawl away far even if I was free lambus whispered Pippin lambus I've got some have you I don't think they've taken anything but our swords yes I had a packet in my pocket answered Mary but it must be better to crumbs anyway I can't put my mouth in my pocket you won't have to I've but just then a Savage kick warned Pippen that the noise had died down and the guards were watchful the night was dark and cold all round the null on which the Orcs were gathered little watchfires sprang up

          
          22:04:47
          gold and red in the darkness a complete ring of them they were within a long bow shot but the Riders didn't show themselves against the light and the Orcs wasted many arrows shooting at the fires until a Gluk stopped them the riters made no sound later in the night when the moon came out of the Mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the white light as they moved in ceaseless Patrol they'll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the Gods why don't

          
          22:05:22
          we get together and charge through what's old grook think he's doing I should like to know I dare say you would SNL stepping up from behind meaning I don't think at all a curse you you're as bad as the other rebel the maggots and the Apes of lugor no good trying to charge with them they just squeal and boat and there are more than enough of these filthy horse boys to mop up our lot on the flat there's only one thing those maggots can do they can see like gimlets in the dark but these white skins have

          
          22:06:01
          better night eyes than most men from all I've heard and don't forget their horses they can see the night Breeze or so it said still there's one thing the fine fellows don't know M wh and his Lads are in the forest and they should turn up anytime now or gl's words were enough apparently to satisfy the Eisen guarders but the other Orcs were both dispirited and rebellious they posted a few Watchers but most of them lay on the ground resting in the pleasant Darkness it did indeed become very dark again for the

          
          22:06:39
          moon passed Westward into thick cloud and Pippen could not see anything a few feet away the fires brought no light to the hilic the Riders were not however content merely to wait for the Dawn and let their enemies rest a sudden outcry on the east side of the null showed that something was wrong it seemed that some of the men had ridden in close slipped off their horses crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several Orcs And then had faded away again wluk dashed off to stop a stampede Pippen and Mary sat up their

          
          22:07:16
          guards eyes and guarders had gone with a Gluk but if the hobbits had any thought of Escape it was soon dashed a long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and Drew them close together dimly they were aware of gish's great head and hideous face between them his foul breath was on their cheeks he began to pour them and feel them Pippin shuted as hard cold fingers groped down his back well my little ones said Gnar in a soft whisper enjoying a nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed perhaps swords

          
          22:07:55
          and whips on one side and nasty Spears on the other little people shouldn't meddle in the fears that too big for them his fingers continued to grope there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes the thought came suddenly into Pippen's mind as if caught direct from the Urgent thought of his enemy crish knak knows about the ring he's looking for it while aook is busy he probably wants it for himself cold fear was in Pippen's heart yet at the same time he was wondering what use he could make of gisho as

          
          22:08:32
          are I don't think you'll find it that way he whispered it isn't easy to find find it said Gnar his fingers stopped crawling and gripped Pippen's shoulder find what what are you talking about little one for a moment Pippen was silent then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat Gollum colum nothing my precious he added the hobbits felt Gish knock's fingers twitch oh hissed the goblin softly that's what he means is it Oho very very dangerous my little ones perhaps said Mary now alert and

          
          22:09:20
          aware of Pippin's guess perhaps and not only for us still you know your business best do you want it or not and what would you give for it do I want it do I want it said Grio as if puzzled but his arms were trembling what would I give for it what do you mean we mean said Pippin choosing his words carefully that it's no good groping in the dark we could save you time and trouble but you must untie our legs first or we'll do nothing and say nothing my dear tender little fools H krishn everything you have and

          
          22:10:06
          everything you know will be got out of you in Du time everything You'll wish there was more than you could tell to satisfy the question indeed you will quite soon we sh hurry the inquiry oh dear no what do you think you've been kept alive for my dear little fellows please believe me when I say that it wasn't out of kindness that's not even one of UK's faults I find it quite easy to believe said Mary but you haven't got your prey home yet and it doesn't seem to be going your way whatever happens if we come to

          
          22:10:46
          ice and God it won't be the great krishock that benefits San will take all that he can find if you want anything for yourself Now's the Time to do a deal grishnak began to lose his temper the name of s seemed especially to enrage him time was passing and the disturbance was dying down or Gluk all the Eisen guarders might return at any minute have you got it either of you he snarled colum Gollum said Pippin untie our legs said Mary they felt the orc's arms trembling violently C you you filthy little Vermin

          
          22:11:30
          he HED and your legs I'll untie every string in your bodies do you think I can't search you to the bones search you I'll catch you both the quivering shreds I don't need the help of your legs to get you away and have you all to myself suddenly he seized them the strength in his long arms and shoulders was terrifying he tucked them one under each armpit and crushed them fiercely to his sides a great stifling hand was clapped over each of their mouths then he sprang forward stooping low quickly and silently he went until

          
          22:12:09
          he came to the edge of the null there choosing a gap between the Watchers he passed like an evil Shadow out into the night down the slope and Away Westward towards the river that flowed out of the forest in that direction there was a wide open space with only one far after going a dozen yards he halted peering and listening nothing could be seen or heard he crept slowly on bent almost double then he squatted and listened again then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash at that very moment the dark form of a ryer

          
          22:12:47
          loomed up right in front of him a horse snorted and reared a man called out Gish knock flung himself on the ground flat dragging the hobbits under him then he drew his sword No Doubt he meant to kill his captives rather than allow them to escape or to be rescued but it was his undoing the sword rang faintly and glinted a little in the light of the far away to his left an arrow came whistling out of the Gloom it was aimed with skill or Guided by fate and it pierced his right hand he dropped the sword and shrieked there was

          
          22:13:26
          a quick beat of hooves and even as gar leapt up and ran he was ridden down and a spear passed through him he gave a hideous shivering cry and lay still the hobbits remained flat on the ground as gak had left them another Horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade's Aid whether because of some special keenness of sight or because of some other sense the horse lifted and sprang lightly over them but its Rider did not see them lying covered in their Elven cloaks to crushed for the moment and too afraid to

          
          22:14:04
          move at last Mary stirred and whispered softly so far so good but how are we to avoid being spitted the answer came almost immediately the cries of Gish knock had roused the Orcs from the yells and screeches that came from the null the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered orluk was probably knocking off a few more heads then suddenly the answering cries of orc voices came from the right outside the circle of watch fars from the direction of the forest and the mountains mahor had apparently arrived

          
          22:14:43
          and was attacking the besiegers there was the sound of galloping horses the Riders were drawing in their ring close around the null risking the orc arrows so as to prevent any sorty while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers suddenly Mary and Pippen realized that without moving they were now outside the circle there was nothing between them at Escape now said Mary if only we had our legs and hands free we might get away but I can't touch the knots and I can't bite them no need to try said Pippen I

          
          22:15:20
          was going to tell you I've managed to free my hands these Loops are only left for show you'd better have a bit of lambus first he slipped the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet the cakes were broken but good still in their Leaf wrappings the hobbits each ate two or three pieces The Taste brought back to them the memory of fair faces and laughter and wholesome food in quiet days now far away for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting in the dark heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby Pippen was the first to

          
          22:15:56
          come back to the present we must be off he said half a moment Gish knock's sword was lying close at hand but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use so he crawled forward and finding the body of the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife with this he quickly cut their bonds now for it he said when we've warmed up a bit better we shall be able to stand again and walk but in any case we'd better start by crawling they crawled the turf was deep and yielding and that helped them but it seemed a

          
          22:16:34
          long slow business they gave the watchfire a wide birth and wormed their way forward bit by bit until they came to the edge of the river gurgling away in the black Shadows under its deep Banks then they looked about the sounds had died away evidently mohor and his Lads had been killed or driven off the Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil it wouldn't last very much longer already the night was old in the East which had remained unclouded the sky was beginning to grow pale we must get under cover said Pippin

          
          22:17:14
          or we shall be seen it'll not be any comfort to us if these Riders discover that we're not Oaks after we're dead he got up and stamped his feet those cords have cut me like wires but my feet are getting warm again I could stagger on now what about you Mary Mary got up yes he said I can manage it lambus does put heart into you a more wholesome sort of feeling too than the heat of the oak draft I wonder what it was made of better not to know I expect let's get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it not here the

          
          22:17:56
          banks are too steep said pipin forward now they turned and wed walked side by side slowly along the line of the river behind them the light grew in the east as they walked they compared notes talking lightly in Hobbit fashion of the things that had happened since their capture no listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered cruy and been in dire Peril going without hope towards torment and death or that even now as they well knew they had little chance of ever finding friend

          
          22:18:29
          or safety again you seem to have been doing well Master toque said Mary you will get almost a chapter in Old Bilbo's book If Ever I get a chance to report to him good work especially guessing that hairy villains little game and playing up to him but I wonder if anyone will ever pick up your Trail and find that brooch I should hate to lose mine but I'm afraid yours has gone for good I shall have to brush up my toes if I'm to get level with you indeed cousin brandybuck is going in front now this is where he comes in I

          
          22:19:07
          don't suppose you've much notion where we are but I spent my time at rivendel rather better we're walking West along the anent wash the B end of the mountains is in front and fangor Forest even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them night seemed to have taken Refuge under its great trees creeping away from the coming Dawn lead on Master brandybuck said Pippen or lead back we have been warned against fangorn but one so knowing will not have forgotten that I haven't

          
          22:19:45
          answered Mary but the forest seems better to me all the same than turning back into the middle of a battle he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees old Beyond guessing they seemed great trailing beards of light and hung from them blowing and swaying in the breeze Out of the Shadows the hobbits peeped gazing back down the slope little furtive figures that in the dim light looked like elf children in the deeps of time peering out of the Wild Wood in Wonder at their first Dawn far over the Great River and the

          
          22:20:23
          brown lands leagues upon greay leagues away the dawn came red as flame loud rang the hunting horns to greet it the Riders of Rohan sprang suddenly to life horn answered horn again Mary and Pippen her clear in the cold air the nighing of war horses and the sudden singing of many men the sun's limb was lifted an ark of fire above the margin of the world then with a great cry the Riders charged from the East the red light gleamed on maale and spear the Orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them

          
          22:21:01
          The Hobbit saw several Horsemen fall but their line held on up the hill and over it and wheeled round and charged again most of the Raiders that were left alive then broke and fled this way and that pursued one by one to the death but one band holding together in a black wedge drove forward resolutely in the direction of the forest straight up the slope they charged towards the Watchers now they were Drawing Near and it seemed certain that they would Escape they'd already heun down three riders that barred their

          
          22:21:36
          way we've watched too long said Mary there's a Gluk I don't want to meet him again the hobbits turned and fled deep into the Shadows of the wood so it was that they did not see The Last Stand when a Gluk was overtaken and brought to Bay at the very edge of fangor there he was slain At Last by a the third Marshal of the mar who dismounted and fought him sword to sword and over the wide Fields the keen-eyed Riders hunted down the few Orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly then when they had laid

          
          22:22:13
          their fallen comrades in the mound and had sung their praises the Riders made a great fire and Scattered the ashes of their enemies so ended the raid and no news of It Came ever back either to Mordor or to Eisen God but the smoke of of the burning Rose High to heaven and was seen by many watchful eyes chapter 4 tree beard meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as a dark and Tangled Forest allowed following the line of the running stream Westward and up towards the slopes of the mountains deeper and

          
          22:22:57
          deeper into fangorn slowly Their Fear of the died away and their Pace slackened a queer stifling feeling came over them as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing at last Mary halted we can't go on like this he panted I want some air let's have a drink at any rate said Pippen I'm parched he clambered on to a great tree route that wound down into the stream and stooping Drew up some water in his CED hands it was clear and cold and he took many drafts medy followed him the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer

          
          22:23:38
          their hearts for a while they sat together on the brink of the stream dabbling their sore feet and legs and peering round at the trees that stood silently about them rank upon rank until they faded away into gray Twilight in every direction I suppose you haven't lost us already said Pippen leaning back against the great tree trunk we can at least follow the course of this stream the ant wash or whatever you call it and get out again the way we came we could if our legs would do it said Mary and if we

          
          22:24:11
          could breathe properly yes it's all very dim and stuffy in here said Pippen it reminds me somehow of the old room in the great place of the tokes away back in the smiles of tuur a huge place where the furniture has never been moved or changed for Generations they say the old TK lived in it year after year while he and the room got older and shabier together and it has never changed since he died a century ago and old gerontius was my great great grandfather that puts it back a bit but that is nothing to the old feeling of

          
          22:24:50
          this wood look at all those weeping trailing beards and whiskers of lyan and most of the trees seem to be half covered with ragged dry leaves that have ever fallen untidy I can't imagine what spring would look like here if it ever comes still less a spring cleaning but the Sun at any rate must peep in sometimes said Mary it doesn't look or feel at all like Bilbo's description of merkwood that was all dark and black and the home of dark black things this is just dim and frightfully Trish you can't imagine

          
          22:25:29
          animals living here at all or staying for long no nor Hobbits said Pippen and I don't like the thought of trying to get through it either nothing to eat for 100 miles I should guess how are our supplies low said Mary we ran off with nothing but a couple of spare packets of lambers and left everything else behind they looked at what remained of the Elven cakes broken fragments for about five Mega days that was all and not a wrap or a blanket said Mary we should be cold tonight whichever way we go well we'd better decide on the way

          
          22:26:08
          now said Pippen the morning must be getting on just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared someway further on into the wood shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest roof hello said Mary the sun must have run into a cloud while we've been under these trees and now she's run out again or else she's climbed high enough to look down through some opening it isn't far let's go and investigate they found it was further than they thought the ground was Rising steeply still and it was becoming

          
          22:26:47
          increasingly Stony the light grew broader as they went on and soon they saw that there was a rock wall before them the side of a hill or the abrupt end of some long route Thrust out by the distant mountains no trees grew on it and the sun was falling full on its Stony face the Twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff and still as if reaching out to the warmth where all had looked so shabby and gray before the wood now gleamed with Rich Browns and with the smooth black Grays of bark like polished

          
          22:27:21
          leather the bows of the trees glowed with a soft green like young grass early spring or a fleeting vision of it was about them in the face of the Stony wall there was something like a stair natural perhaps and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock for it was rough and uneven high up almost level with the tops of forest trees there was a shelf under a cliff nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its Edge and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left it looked almost like the

          
          22:27:58
          figure of some niled old man standing ing there blinking in the morning light up we go said Mary joyfully now for a breath of air and a sight of the land they climbed and scrambled up the rock if the stair had been made it was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts and soes of their captivity had healed and their Vigor had returned they came at length to the edge of the Shelf almost at the feet of the old stump then

          
          22:28:31
          they sprang up and turned around with their backs to the hill breathing deep and looking Eastward they saw that they had only come three or four miles into the forest the heads of the trees marched down the slope towards the plain there near The Fringe of the forest tall spares of curling black smoke went up waving and floating towards them the wind's changing said Mary it's turned East again it feels cool up here yes said Pippen I'm afraid this is only a passing gleam and it'll all go gray again what a Pity this Shaggy Old Forest

          
          22:29:09
          looks so different in the sunlight I almost felt I liked the place almost felt you liked the forest that's good that's uncommonly kind of you said a strange voice turn round and let me have a look at your faces I almost feel that I dislike you both but do not let us be Hasty turn round a large knob knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders and they were Twisted round gently but irresistibly then two great arms lifted them up they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face it belonged to

          
          22:29:54
          a large manlike almost troll-like figure at least 14 ft High very sturdy with a tall head and hardly any neck whether it was clad in stuff like green and gray bark or whether that was its height was difficult to say at any rate the arms at a short distance from the trunk were not wrinkled but covered with a brown smooth skin the large feet had seven toes each the lower part of the long face was covered with a sweeping Gray beard bushy almost Twiggy at the roots thin and mossy at the ends but at the moment the

          
          22:30:32
          hobbits noted little but the eyes these deep eyes were now surveying them slow and solemn but very penetrating they were Brown shot with a green light often afterwards pipin tried to describe his first impression of them one felt as if there was an enormous well behind them filled up with ages of memory and long slow steady thinking but their was sparkling with a present like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake I don't know but it felt as if something that

          
          22:31:13
          grew in the ground a sleep you might say or just feeling itself as something between root tip and leaf tip between deep Earth and Sky Had suddenly wak up and was considering you with the same slow care that it had given to its own inside Affairs for Endless years murmured The Voice a deep voice like a very deep woodwind instrument very odd indeed do not be Hasty that is my motto but if I had seen you before I heard your voices I liked them nice little voices they reminded me of something I cannot remember if I had

          
          22:31:59
          seen you before before I heard you I should have just trodden on you taking you for little Orcs and found out my mistake afterwards very odd you are indeed root and Twig very odd Pippen though still amazed no longer felt afraid under those eyes he felt a curious suspense but not fear please he said who are you and what are you a queer look came into the old eyes a kind of weariness the Deep Wells were covered over now answered the voice well I am an ant or that's what they call me yes an is the word the ant I am you might say

          
          22:32:48
          in your manner of speaking fangor is my name According to some tree beard others make it a tree beard will do an ant said Mary what's that but what do you call yourself what's your real name oh no replied treid who now that would be telling not so Hasty and I am doing the asking you are in my country what are you I wonder I cannot place you you do not seem to come in the old list that I learned when I was young but that was a long long time ago and they may have some new lists let me see let me see how

          
          22:33:34
          did it go learn now the Lord of living creatures first name the four the free peoples eldest of all the elf children dwarf the Delver dark are his houses ENT the earthborn old as mountain men the Mortal master of [Music] horses be the Builder Buck the leaper bear bee hunter bore the fighter Hound is hungry hair is [Music] fearful Eagle in iy Ox in pasture heart horn crowned Hawk is swiftest Swan the whitest serpent coldest how did it go tum it was a long list but anyway you do not seem to fit in

          
          22:34:36
          anywhere we always seem to have got left out of the old lists and the old stories said Mary yet we've been about for quite a long time we Hobbits why not make a new line said Pippen half drown Hobbits the whole dwellers put us in amongst the four next to man the big people and you've got it h not not bad not bad said tree beard that would do so you live in holes eh it sounds very right and proper who calls you Hobbits though that does not sound Elvish to me elves made all the old words they began it nobody else calls us

          
          22:35:20
          Hobbits we call ourselves that said Pippen whom come now not so Hasty you call yourselves Hobbit but you should not go telling just anybody you'll be letting out your own right names if you're not careful we aren't careful about that said Mary as a matter of fact I'm a brandy Buck maradu brandybuck though most people call me just marry and I'm a toque peragine toque but I'm generally called Pippin or even pip H but you are Hasty folk I see said tree I I am honored by your confidence but you should not be too free all at once there

          
          22:36:05
          are ants and ants you know or there are ants and things that look like ants but ain't as you might say I'll call you medy and Pippin if you please nice names for I am not going to tell you my name not yet at any rate a queer half- knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes for one thing it would take a long while my name is growing all the time and I've lived a very long long time so my name is like a story real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language

          
          22:36:45
          in the old en as you might say it is a lovely language but it takes a very long time to say anything in it because we do not say anything in it unless it is worth taking a long time to say and to listen to but now and the eyes became very bright and present seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp what is going on what are you doing in it all I can see and hear and smell and feel a great deal from this from this from this alal la la Roomba command Lindo Bor excuse me that is a part of my name for it I do not know what the word is in

          
          22:37:32
          the outside languages you know the thing we are on where I stand and look out on fine mornings and think about the sun and the grass beyond the wood and the horses and the clouds and the unfolding of the world what is going on what is gandal up to and these B room he made a deep rumbling noise like a Discord on a great organ these Orcs And young San down at eard I like news but not too quick now there is quite a lot going on said Mary and even if we tried to be quick it would take a long time to tell but you

          
          22:38:15
          told us not to be Hasty ought we to tell you anything so soon would you think it rude if we asked what you were going to do with us and which side you're on and did you know Gandalf yes I do know him the only wizard that really cares about trees said tree beard do you know him yes said Pippen sadly we did he was a great friend and he was our guide then I can answer your other questions said tree beard I am not going to do anything with you not if you mean by that do something to you without your

          
          22:38:56
          leave we might do some things together I don't know about sides I go my own way but your way may go along with mine for a while but you speak of Master Gandalf as if he was in a story that had come to an end yes we do said Pippen sadly the story seems to be going on but I'm afraid Gandalf has fallen out of it oh come now said tree bed oh well he paused looking long at the hobbits H oh well I do not know what to say come now if you would like to hear more said Mary we will tell you but it'll take

          
          22:39:40
          some time wouldn't you like to put us down couldn't we sit here together in the sun while it lasts you must be getting tired of holding us up H tired no I am not tired I do not easily get tired and I do not sit down I am not very H bendable but there the Sun is going in let us leave this did you say what you call it Hill suggested Pippen shelf step suggested Mary tree bear repeated the words thoughtfully H yes that was it but it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped never

          
          22:40:29
          mind mind let us leave it and go where shall we go asked Mary to my home or one of my homes answered tree bird is it far I do not know you might call it far perhaps but what does that matter well you see we've lost all our belongings said Mary we have only a little food oh whom you need not trouble about that said tree bird I can give you a drink that will keep you green and growing for a long long while and if we decide to part company I can set you down outside my country at any point you choose let

          
          22:41:10
          us go holding the hobbits gently but firmly one in the crook of each arm tree beard lifted up first one large foot and then the other and moved them to the edge of the Shelf the root likee toes grasp the Rocks then carefully and solemnly he he stalked down from step to step and reached the floor of the forest at once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees deeper and deeper into the wood never far from the stream climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountains many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware

          
          22:41:50
          of him as of any other creature that merely passed by but some quivered and some raised up their branches above his head as he approached all all the while as he walked he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical sounds the hobbits were silent for some time they felt oddly enough safe and comfortable and they had a great deal to think and wonder about at last pipin ventured to speak again please tree beard he said could I ask you something why did calborn warn us against your Forest he told us not to

          
          22:42:27
          risk getting entangled in it H did he know rumbled tree beard and I might have said much the same if you had been going the other way do not risk getting entangled in the woods of laor Lindor that is what the elves used to call it but now they make the name shorter lothlorian they call it perhaps they are right maybe it is fading not growing land of the valley of singing gold that was it once upon a time now it is the dream flower oh well but it is a queer place and not for just anyone to venture in I am surprised that you ever

          
          22:43:14
          got out but much more surprised that you ever got in that has not happened to strangers from many a year it is a queer land and so is this folk have come to grief here I they they have to grief laor Lindo Mal Oran or Marin he hummed to himself they are falling rather behind the world in there I guess he said neither this country nor anything else outside the golden wood is what it was when kelborn was young still [Music] are Lor that is what they used to say things have changed but it is still true in

          
          22:44:08
          places what do you mean said Pippen what is true the trees and the Ants said tree bird I do not understand all that goes on myself so I cannot explain it to you some of us are still true ants and Lively enough in our fashion but many are growing sleepy go tree is as you might say most of the trees are just trees of course but many are half a weake some are quite wide awake and a few are well are well getting enish that is going on all the time when that happens to a tree you find that some have bad hearts nothing

          
          22:44:53
          to do with their wood I do not mean that why I knew some good old fellows down the end wash gone long ago alas they were quite Hollow indeed they were falling all to pieces but as quiet and sweet spoken as a young leaf and there are some trees in The Valleys under the mountains sound as a bell and bad right through that sort of thing seems to spread there used to be some very dangerous Parts in this country there are still some very black Petes like the old Forest away to the north do you mean asked Mary I I something like

          
          22:45:36
          but much worse I do not doubt there is some shadow of the great Darkness lying there still away North and bad memories are handed down but there are Hollow Dales in this land where the darkness has never been lifted and the trees are older than I am still we do what we can we keep off strangers and the fool hard and we train and we teach we walk and we weed we are three herds we old an few enough of us are left now sheep get like Shepherd and Shepherds like sheep it is said but slowly and neither have long in

          
          22:46:18
          the world it is quicker and closer with trees and ANS and they walk down the ages together for ANS are more like elves less interested in themselves than men are and better at getting inside other things and yet again ants are more like men more changeable than elves are and quicker at taking the color of the outside you might say or better than both for they are steadier and keep their minds on things longer some of my kin look just like trees now and need something great to Rouse them and they speak only in

          
          22:46:58
          Whispers but some of my trees are Lim Li and many can talk to me elves began it of course waking trees up and teaching them to speak and learning their tree talk they always wished to talk to everything the old elves did but then the great Darkness came and they passed away over the sea all fled into far valleys and hid themselves and made songs about days that would never come again never again I I there was all one wood Once Upon a Time from here to the mountains of Lon and this was just the East End those

          
          22:47:40
          were the broad days time was when I could walk and sing all day and hear no more than the echo of my own voice in The Hollow Hills the woods were like the woods of Lo laan only thicker stronger younger and the smell of the air I used to spend a week just breathing Tri beard felt silent striding along and yet making hardly a sound with his great feet then he began to hum again and passed into a murmuring chant gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them in the willow me of tar I walked in

          
          22:48:26
          the spring are the sight and the smell of the spring in naron and I said that was good I wondered in summer in the elm Woods of O and ah the light and the music in the summer by the Seven Rivers of oir and I thought that was best to the beaches of neor I came in the Autumn ah the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the autum inor it was more than my desire to the pine trees upon the Highland of doron and I climbed in the winter H the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of winter upon orod

          
          22:49:18
          naon my voice went up and sang in the sky and now all those lands lie under the wave and I walk in um ARA in torna in alom in my own land in the country of fangor where the roots are long and the years lie thicker than the leaves in Tor alom he entered and stro on silently and in all the wood as far as ear could reach there was not a sound the day waned and DUS was twined about the bolds of the trees at last The Hobbit saw Rising dimly before them a steep dark land they had come to the feet of the mountains and to the green

          
          22:50:11
          roots of tall methed down the hillside the young anash leaping from its Springs High Above ran noisily from step to step to meet them on the right of the stream there was a long slope clad with grass now gray in the Twilight no trees grew there and it was open to the Sky Stars were shining already in Lakes between the shores of cloud tree beard stroe up the slope hardly slackening his Pace suddenly before them The Hobbit saw a wide opening two great trees stood there one on either side like living gate posts

          
          22:50:51
          but there was no gate save their Crossing and interwoven boughs as the old ENT approached the trees lifted up up their branches and all their leaves quivered and rustled for they were evergreen trees and their leaves were dark and Polished and gleamed in the Twilight Beyond them was a wide level space as though the floor of a Great Hall had been cut in the side of the hill on either hand of the walls sloped upwards until they were 50 ft high or more and along each wall stood an aisle of trees that also increased in height

          
          22:51:25
          as they marched inwards at the far end the rock wall was sheer but at the bottom it had been hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof the only roof of the hall save the branches of the trees which at the inner end overshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle a little stream escaped from the Springs above and leaving the main water fell tinkling down the sheer face of the wall pouring in silver drops like a fine curtain in front of the arched Bay the water was gathered again into a

          
          22:52:00
          stone Basin in the floor between the trees and then it spilled and flowed away beside the open path out to rejoin the ENT wash in its journey through the forest H here we are said tree bird breaking his long silence I have brought you about 70,000 in strides but what that comes to in the measurement of your land I do not know anyway we are near the roots of the last Mountain part of the name of this place might be welling Hall if it were turned into your language I like it we will stay here tonight he set them down on the grass

          
          22:52:42
          between the aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the great Arch the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees hardly bent but his legs opened in a great stride he planted his big toes and they were indeed big and very broad on the ground first before any other part of his feet for a moment tree beard stood under the rain of the falling spring and took a deep breath then he laughed and passed inside a great Stone table stood near but no chairs at the back of the bay it was already quite dark tree beard lifted two

          
          22:53:19
          great vessels and stood them on the table they seemed to be filled with water but he held his hands over them and immediately they began to Glow one with a golden and the other with a rich green light and the blending of the two lights lit the bay as if the sun of Summer was shining through a roof of young leaves Looking Back The Hobbit saw that the trees in the court had also begun to Glow faintly at first but steadily quickening until every leaf was edged with light some green some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks

          
          22:53:57
          looked like pillars molded out of luminous Stone well well now we can talk again said tree beard you are thirsty I expect perhaps you're all tired drink this he went to the back of the bay and then they saw that several tall Stone jars stood there with heavy Lids he removed one of the lids and dipped in a great Ladle and with it filled three bowls one very large and two smaller ones this is an an house he said and there are no seats I fear but you may sit on the table picking up the hobbits he set

          
          22:54:38
          them on the great stone slab 6 feet above the ground and there they sat dangling their legs and drinking in sips the drink was like water indeed very like the taste of the drafts they had drunk from the ENT wash near the borders of the forest and yet there was some scent or Savor in it which they could not cribe it was faint but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night the effect of the draft began at the toes and Rose steadily through every limb bringing refreshment and vigor as

          
          22:55:14
          it CED upwards right to the tips of the hair indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads was actually standing up waving and curling and growing as for tree beard he first led his feet in in the Basin beyond the arch and then he drained his bowl at one draft one long slow draft the hobbits thought he would never stop at last he set the bowl down [Music] again he s m now we can talk easier you can sit on the floor and I will lie down that will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to

          
          22:55:54
          sleep on the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs not more than a couple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and Bracken tree beard lowered himself slowly onto this with only the slightest sign of bending at his middle until he lay at full length with his arms behind his head looking up at the ceiling upon which lights were flickering like the play of leaves in the sunshine Mary and Pippen sat beside him on pillows of grass now tell me your tale and do not hurry said tree beard the hobbits began

          
          22:56:31
          to tell him the story of their Adventures ever since they left hobbiton they followed no very clear order for they interrupted one another continually and tree beir often stopped the speaker and went back to some earlier point or jumped forward asking questions about later events they said nothing whatever about the ring and did not tell him why they set out or where they were going to and he did not ask for any reasons he was immensely interested in everything in the Black Riders In elron And rivendel in the Old Forest and Tom

          
          22:57:08
          Bombadil in the minds of Moria and in Loth laan and Galadriel he made them describe the Sha and its country over and over again he said an odd thing at this point you never see any H any ants around there do you he asked well not ANS an wives I should really say an wives said Pippen are they like you at all yes well no I do not really know now said tree beard thoughtfully but they would like your country so I just wondered tree bead was however especially interested in everything that concerned Gandalf and most interested of

          
          22:57:54
          all in San's doings the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them only a rather vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told the council but they were clear at any rate that ugluk and his troop came from eard and spoke of San as their Master said Treebeard when at last their story had wound and wandered down to the battle of the Orcs And The Riders of Rowan well well that is a bundle of news and no mistake you have not told me all no indeed not by a long way but I do not doubt that you are doing as gandal would

          
          22:58:35
          wish there is something very big going on that I can see and what it is maybe I shall learn in good time or in bed time by root and Twig but it is a strange business UPS sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists and behold the nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them and gandal takes them on a great journey and gadriel harbors them in carus gathon and Oaks pursue them down all the leagues of wilderland indeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm I hope they weather it and what about yourself asked Mary

          
          22:59:19
          H I have not troubled about the great Wars said tree beard they mostly concern elves and men that is the business of wizards Wizards are always troubled about the future I do not like worrying about the future I'm not allog together on anybody's side because nobody is altogether on my side if you understand me nobody cares for the woods as I care for them not even elves nowadays still I take more kindly to elves than to others it was the elves that cured us of dumbness long ago and that was a g great

          
          22:59:58
          gift that cannot be forgotten though our ways have parted since and there are some things of course whose side I am altogether not on I am against them all together these Borum he again made a deep Rumble of disgust these Orcs and their masters I used to be anxious when the shadow lay on merkwood but when it removed to Mordor I did not trouble for a while Mordor is a long way away but it seems that the wind is setting East and the withering of all Woods may be Drawing Near there is not that an old

          
          23:00:39
          ant can do to hold back that storm he must weather it or crack but San now San is a neighbor I cannot overlook him I must do something I suppose I have often wondered lately what I should do about San who is Saran asked Pippen do you know anything about his history Saran is a wizard answered tree be more than that I cannot say I do not know the history of wizards they appeared first after the great ships came over the sea but if they came with the ships I never can tell S A man was reckoned great among

          
          23:01:22
          them I believe he gave up wandering about and minding the Affairs of men and elves some time ago you would call it a very long time ago and he settled down at anost or eard as the men of Rohan call it he was very quiet to begin with but his Fame began to grow he was chosen to be head of the white Council they say but that did not turn out too well I wonder now if even then San was not turning to evil ways but at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbors I used to talk to him there was a time

          
          23:02:03
          when he was always walking about my Woods he was polite in those days always asking my leave at least when he met me and always eager to listen I told him many things that he would never have found out by himself but he never repaid me in like kind I cannot remember that he ever told me anything and he got more and more like that his face as I remember it I've not seen it for many a day became like Windows in the stone wall windows with shutters inside I think that I now understand what he's up to he is plotting to become

          
          23:02:45
          a Power he has a mind of metal and wheels and he does not care for growing things except as far as they serve him for the moment and now it is clear that he is a a black traitor he has taken up with foul folk with the Orcs Brom boom worse than that he has been doing something to them something dangerous for these I and guarders are more like wicked men it is a mark of evil things that came in the great darkness that they cannot abide the Sun but San's Orcs can endure it even if they hate it I wonder what he has done are they men he

          
          23:03:29
          has ruined or has he Blended the races Of Orcs And Men that would be a black evil Treebeard rumbled for a moment as if he were pronouncing some deep Subterranean entish malediction some time ago I began to wonder how ORS dared to pass through my woods so freely he went on only lately did I guess that San was to blame and that long ago he had been spying out all the ways and discovering my secrets he and his foul folk are making Havoc now down on the borders they are felling trees good trees some of the trees they

          
          23:04:10
          just cut down and leave to rot orc Mischief that but most are HED up and carried off to feed the fires of waron there is always a smoke rising from Eisen guard these days curse him root and Branch many many of those trees were my friends creatures I had known from knot and acorn many had voices of their own that are lost forever now and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were singing Groves I have been idle I have let things slip it must stop tree beard raised himself from his bed

          
          23:04:51
          with a jerk stood up and thumped his hand on the table the vessels of light trembled and sent up two Jets of flame there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes and his beard stood out stiff as a great beasom I will stop it he boomed and you shall come with me you may be able to help me you will be helping your own friends that way too for if seron is not checked Rohan and gondo will have an enemy behind as well as in front our roads go together to e andard we will come with you said Mary we will do what

          
          23:05:31
          we can yes said Pippen I should like to see the white hand overthrown I should like to be there even if I could not be of much use I shall never forget ugluk and the crossing of Rohan good good said tree beard but I spoke hastily we must not be Hasty I become too hot I must cool myself and think for it is easier to shout stop then to do it he stro to the archway and stood for some time under the Falling Rain of the spring then he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops of water fell glittering from him to the ground they

          
          23:06:12
          glinted like red and green Sparks he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again he seemed to be counting on his fingers fungone finglass flood rff I I he sighed the trouble is that there are so few of us left he said turning towards the hobbits only three remain of the first ants that walked in the woods before the darkness only myself fangon and finglass and flood rff to give them their Elish names you may call them leaflock and skinbar

          
          23:06:54
          if you like that better and of us three leaf flock and Skin Bar are not much use for this business leaflock has grown sleepy almost tree is you might say he is taken to standing by himself half asleep all through the summer with a deep grass of The Meadows around his knees covered with leafy hair he is he used to rise up in winter but of late he's been too drowsy to walk far even then skinbar lived on the mountain slopes west of Eisen guard then that is where the worst trouble has been he was wounded by the Orcs And many of his folk

          
          23:07:33
          and his tree herds have been murdered and destroyed he's gone up into the high places among The Birches that he loves best and he will not come down still I dare say I could get together a fair company of our younger folk if I can make them understand the need if I could Rouse them we are not a hasty folk what a Pity there are so few us why are there so few when you've lived in this country so long asked Pippen have a great many died oh no said tread none have died from inside as you might say some have

          
          23:08:11
          fallen in the evil chances of the long years of course and more have grown Tre but there were never many of us and we've not increased there have been no Tings no children you would say not for a terrible Long Count of years you see we lost the an wives how very sad said pibon how was it that they all died they did not die said tree be I never said died we lost them I said we lost them and we cannot find them he sighed I thought most folk knew that there were songs about The Hunt of the ants for the ant wives sung among

          
          23:08:55
          elves and men from mwood to gondo they cannot be quite forgotten well I'm afraid the songs have not come West over the mountains to the sh said Mary won't you tell us some more or sing us one of your songs yes I will indeed said tree beard seeming pleased with the request but I cannot tell it properly only in short and then we must end our talk tomorrow we have councils to call and work to do and maybe a journey to begin it is rather a strange and sad story he went on after a pause when the world was young and the woods were wide

          
          23:09:41
          and wild the ANS and the Ant wives and there were ant maidens then ah the loveliness of fim breel of w liim the lightf footed in the days of our youth they walked together and they housed together but our hearts did not go on growing in the same way the ants gave their love to things that they met in the world and the Ant wives gave their thought to other things for the ants loved the great trees and the Wild Woods and the slopes of the high hills and they drank of the Mountain Streams and ate only such fruit as the trees let

          
          23:10:21
          fall in their path and they learned Of The Elves and spoke with the trees but the ant wives gave their minds to the Lesser trees and to the Mes in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests and they saw the slow in the thicket and the wild apple and the Cherry blossoming in Spring and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer and the seeding grasses in the Autumn Fields they did not desire to speak with these things but they wished them to hear and obey what was said to them the ant wives ordered them to grow

          
          23:10:56
          according to their their wishes and bear leaf and fruit to their liking for the ant wives desired order and plenty and Peace by which they meant that things should remain where they had set them so the ant wives made Gardens to live in but we ants went on wandering and we only came to the gardens now and again then when the darkness came in the north the ant wives crossed the Great River and made new Gardens and till New fields and we saw them more seldom after the darkness was overthrown the land of the entwives blossomed

          
          23:11:34
          richly and their fields were full of corn many men learned the crafts of the entwives and honored them greatly but we were only a legend to them a secret in the heart of the forest yet here we still are while all The Gardens of the entwives are wasted men call them the brown lands now I remember it was long ago in the time of the war between saon and the men of the sea the Zar came over me to see F brael again very fair she was still in my eyes when I had last seen her though little like the ant

          
          23:12:14
          maiden of old for the ant wives were bent and browned by their labor their hair parched by the Sun to the Hue of ripe cord and their cheeks like red apples yet Their Eyes Were still the eyes of our own people we crossed over andwin and came to their land but we found a desert it was all burned and uprooted for war had passed over it but the ant wives were not there long we called and long we searched and we asked all folk that we met which way the ant wives had gone some said they had never seen them

          
          23:12:51
          and some said that they had seen them walking away West and some said East and others South but nowhere that we went could we find them our sorrow was very great yet the Wildwood called and we turned to it for many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the an wives looking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful names But as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far and now the ant wives are only a memory for us and our beards are long and gray the elves made

          
          23:13:28
          many songs concerning the search of the int and some of the songs passed into the tongues of men but we made no songs about it being content to chant their beautiful names when we thought of the ant wives we believe that we may meet again in a time to come and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land where we can live together and both be content but it is foreboded that that will only be when we have both lost all that we know have and it may well be that that time is Drawing Near at last for if Sauron of

          
          23:14:04
          old destroyed the gardens the enemy today seems likely to wither all the woods there was an Elvish song that spoke of this or at least so I understand it it used to be sung up and down the Great River it was never an ansh song Mark you it would have been a very long song in entish but we know it by heart and hum it now and again this is how it runs in your tongue the an sings When spring unfolds the beach and leaf and sap is in the bow when light is on the Wild Wood stream and wind is on the brow when stride is long and breath

          
          23:14:54
          is deep and ke the m come back to me come back to me and say my land is fair and the Ant wife replies when spring is come to goth and field and corn is in the blade when Blossom like a shining snow is on on the orchard laid when show and Sun upon the Earth with fragrance fill the air I linger here and will not come because my land is fair so the an sings When some lies upon the world and in a noon of gold beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold when Woodland Halls are green and

          
          23:16:12
          cool and wind is in the west come back to me come back to me and say my land is best and the Ant wife replies when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry Brown when straw is gold and ear is white and harest comes to town when honey spills and apple swells though wind be the West I linger here benath the sun because my land is best when wind comes the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay when tree shall fall and starless night Devour the sunless day when wind is in the deadly East then in the bitter

          
          23:17:29
          rain I look for thee and call to thee I'll come to thee again when winter comes and singing ends when Darkness Falls at last when broken is the baron bow and light and labor past I'll look for thee and wait for thee until we meet again together we will take the road beneath the bit rain together we will take the road that leads into the worst and far away we'll find a land where both our hearts May rest tree beard ended his song that is how it goes he said it is Elvish of course lighthearted quick worded and

          
          23:18:47
          soon over I dare say it is fair enough but the ants could say more on their side if they had time but now I'm going to stand up and take a little sleep where will you stand we usually lie down to sleep said Mary we shall be all right where we are lie down to sleep said treebird why of course you do I was forgetting singing that song Put Me In Mind of Old Times almost thought that I was talking to Young Tings I did well you can lie on the bed I'm going to stand in the rain good night Mary and Pippen climbed onto the

          
          23:19:29
          bed and curled up in the soft grass and fern it was fresh and sweet scented and warm the lights died down and the glow of the trees faded but outside under the arch they could see old tree beard standing motionless with his arms raised above his head the bright stars peered out of the sky and lit the falling water as it spilled onto his fingers and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops onto his feet listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep they woke to find a cool sun

          
          23:20:04
          shining into the great court and onto the floor of the bay shreds of High Cloud were overhead running on a stiff easterly wind tree beard was not to be seen But while Mary and Pippen were bathing in the Basin by the arch they heard him humming and singing as he came up the path between the trees ho ho good morning Mary and Pippen he boomed when he saw them you sleep long I've been many aund strides already today now we will have a drink and go to int moot he poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar but from a

          
          23:20:44
          different jar The Taste was not the same as it had been the night before it was earthier and richer more sustaining and food likee so to speak while the hobbits drank sitting on the edge of the bed and nibbling small pieces of Elf cake more because they felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than because they felt hungry tree Birds stood humming in entish or Elish or some strange tongue and looking up at the sky where is ant moot Pippin ventured to ask who a an moot said Treebeard turning

          
          23:21:22
          round it is not a place it is a gathering of ants which does not happen often nowadays but I have managed to make a fair number promised to come we shall meet in the place where we have always met turn Dingle men call it it is away South from here we must be there before noon before long they set off tree beard carried The Hobbit in his arms as on the previous day at the entrance to the court he turned to the right stepped over the stream and strolled away Southward along the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were

          
          23:22:00
          scanty above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and Rowan and Beyond them dark climbing pinewoods soon tree beard turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep Groves where the trees were larger taller and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before for a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn but but it soon passed tree bear did not talk to them he hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully but Mary and pipin

          
          23:22:35
          caught no proper words it sounded like boom boom rum boom boom boom boom boom boom and so on with a constant change of note and Rhythm now and again they thought they heard an answer a hum or a quiver of sound that seemed to come out of the Earth or from boughs above their heads or perhaps from the bows of the trees but tree beard did not stop or turn his head to either side they had been going for a long while Pippen had tried to keep count of the an strides but it failed getting lost at about 3,000 when tree beard

          
          23:23:14
          began to slacken his Pace suddenly he stopped put the hobbits down and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube then he blew or C through them a great whom hum rang out like a deep throated horn in the woods and seemed to Echo from the trees far off they came from several directions a similar whom H whom that was not an echo but an answer tree beard now perched Mary and Pippen on his shoulders and stroe on again every now and then sending out another horn call and each time the

          
          23:23:54
          answers came louder and nearer in this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before they branched out right from the roots and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless Holly and they bore many stiff upright flower spikes with large shining Olive colored buds turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge tree beard came in a few strides to a narrow entrance through it A Worn Path passed and died

          
          23:24:30
          suddenly down a long steep slope the hobbits saw that they were descending into a great Dingle almost as round as a bowl very wide and deep crowned at the rim with a high dark Evergreen hedge it was smooth and grass clad inside and there were no trees except three very tall and beautiful silver Birches that stood at the bottom of the bowl two other paths LED down into the Dingle from the west and from the East several ants had already arrived more were coming in down the other paths and some were now following tree beard

          
          23:25:09
          as they drew near the hobbits gazed at them they had expected to see a number of creatures as much like tree beard as one Hobbit is like another at any rate to a stranger's eye and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind the ants were as different from one another as trees from trees some as different as one tree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and history and some as different as one tree kind from another as birt from Beach Oak from fur there were a few

          
          23:25:41
          older ants bearded and garlik hail but ancient trees though none looked as ancient as tree beard and there were tall strong ants clean limed and smooth skinned like forest trees in their Prime but there were no young ants no saplings altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the Dingle and as many more were marching in at first Mary and Pippen were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw the many shapes and colors the differences in girth and height and length of leg

          
          23:26:18
          and arm and in the number of toes and fingers anything from 3 to 9 a few seemed more or less related to tree beard and reminded them of beach trees or Oaks but there were other kinds some recall the chestnut brown skinned ents with large spay fingered hands and short thick legs some recall the ash tall straight gray ants with many fingered hands and Long Legs some the fur the tallest ants and others the Birch the Rowan and the Linden but when the ants all all gathered round tree beard bowing their heads slightly murmuring in their

          
          23:27:01
          slow musical voices and looking long and intently at the strangers then The Hobbit saw that they were all of the same Kindred and all had the same eyes not all so old or so deep as tree beards but all with the same slow steady thoughtful expression and the same green flicker as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in a Wide Circle round tree beard a curious and unintelligible conversation began the ants began to murmur slowly first one joined and then another until they were all chanting together in a long rising

          
          23:27:40
          and falling Rhythm now louder on one side of the Ring now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side though he could not catch or understand any of the words he supposed the language was entish Pippen found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first but gradually his attention wavered after a long time and the Chance showed no signs of slackening he found himself wondering since entish was such an unhy language whether they had yet got further than good morning and if tree beard was to call the role how many

          
          23:28:17
          days it would take to sing all their names I wonder what the anti is for yes or no he thought he yawned tree bed was immediately aware of him H hey my Pippin he said and the other ants all stopped their chant you are a hasty folk I was forgetting and anyway it is weird some listening to a speech you do not understand you may get down now I've told your names to the end Moot and they have seen you and they have agreed that you are not Orcs And that a new line shall be put in the old lists we have

          
          23:28:55
          got no further yet but that is quick work for an an moot now you and Mary can stroll about in the Dingle if you like there is a well of good water if you need refreshing away Yonder in the North Bank there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins I will come and see you again and tell you how things are going he put the hobbits down before they walked away they bowed low this feat seemed to amuse the ants very much to judged by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker of their eyes but they

          
          23:29:30
          soon turned back to their own business Mary and Pippen climbed up the path that came in from the west and looked through the opening in the great hedge Long Tree clad slopes Rose from the lip of the Dingle and Away Beyond them above the fur trees of the furthest Ridge There Rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain southwards to the left they could see the forest Falling Away down into the gray distance there far away there was a pale green glimmer that Mary guessed to be a glimpse of the Plains of

          
          23:30:04
          Rohan I wonder where eard is said Pippen I don't know quite where we are said Mary but that Peak is probably meadas and as far as I can remember the Ring of I andard lies in a fork or deep Cliff at the end of the mountains it is probably down behind this great Ridge there seems to be a smoke or Haze over there left of the peak don't you think what is ice and guard like said Pippen I wonder what ants can do about it anyway so do I said Mary I and guard is a sort of Ring of rocks or Hills I think with a flat space inside and an

          
          23:30:48
          island or pillar of rock in the middle called orank San has a tower on it there is a gate perhaps more than one in the encircling wall and I believe there is a stream running through it it comes out of the Mountains and flows on across the gap of Rowan it doesn't seem the sort of place for ants to tackle but I have an odd feeling about these ANS somehow I don't think they're quite as safe and well funny as they seem they seem slow queer and patient almost sad and yet I believe they could be roused if that

          
          23:31:24
          happened I'd rather not be on the other side yes said Pippen I know what you mean there might be all the difference between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bull charging and the change might come suddenly I wonder if tree beard will Rouse them I'm sure he means to try but they don't like being roused tree beard got roused himself last night and then bottled it up again the hobbits turned back the voices of the ants were still rising and falling in their conclave the sun had now risen high

          
          23:32:01
          enough to look over the high Hedges it gleamed on the tops of The Birches and lit the northward side of the Dingle with a coold yellow light there they saw a little glittering Fountain they walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of the Evergreens it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again and not to be in a hurry and then they climbed down to the gushing water they drank a little a clean cold sharp draft and sat down on a Mossy Stone watching the patches of sun on the grass and the Shadows of the

          
          23:32:35
          sailing clouds passing over the floor of the Dingle the murmur of the ant went on it seemed very strange and remote place outside their world and far from everything that had ever happened to them a great longing came over them for the faces and voices of their companions especially for Frodo and Sam and for Strider at last they came a pause in the end voices and looking up they saw tree beard coming towards them with another ant at his side here I am again said Treebeard are you getting weary or feeling

          
          23:33:15
          impatient well I'm afraid that you must not get impatient yet we've finished the first stage now but I've still got to explain things again to those that live a long way off far from henard and those that I could not get round to before the Moot and after that we shall have to decide what to do however deciding what to do does not take in so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about still it's no use denying we shall be here a long time yet a couple of days very likely so I

          
          23:33:55
          brought you a comp ion he has an an House nearby pralad is his Elish name he says he has already made up his mind and does not need to remain at the mood he is the nearest thing about us to a hasty end you ought to get on together goodbye treid turned and left them balad stood for some time surveying The Hobbit solemnly and they looked at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness he was tall and seemed to be one of the younger ants he had smooth shining skin on his arms and legs his

          
          23:34:35
          lips were Ruddy and his hair was gray green he could Bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was higher and clearer than tree beards my friends let us go for a walk he said I am bread that is quick be in your language but it is only a nickname of course they have called me that ever since I said yes to an elder in before he had finished his question also I drink quickly and go out while some are still wetting their beards come with me he reached down two shapely arms and

          
          23:35:15
          gave a long fingered hand to each of the hobbits all that day they walked about in the woods with him singing and laughing for quick beam often laughed he laughed if the sun came out from behind the cloud he laughed If They Came Upon a stream or spring then he stooped and splashed his feet and head with water he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees whenever he saw a Rowan tree he halted a while with his arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he sang at nightfall he brought them to his

          
          23:35:48
          an house nothing more than a Mossy Stone set upon turves under a green Bank Rowan trees grew in a circle about it and there was water as in all an houses a spring bubbling out from the bank they talked for a while as Darkness fell on the forest not far away the voices of the anmut could be heard still going on but now they seemed deeper and less leisurely and every now and again one great voice would rise into high and quickening music while all the others died away but beside them balad spoke gently

          
          23:36:28
          in their own tongue almost whispering and they learned that he belonged to skinbar people and the country where they had lived had been ravaged that seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his hastiness at least in the matter of Orcs there were Rowan trees in my home said balad softly and sadly Rowan trees that took root when I was an enting many many years ago in the quiet of the world the oldest were planted by the ANS to try and please the ant wives but they looked at them and smiled and said that

          
          23:37:08
          they knew where white of Blossom and richer fruit were growing yet there are no trees of all that race the people of the rose that are so beautiful to me and these trees grew and grew till the shadow of each was like a green Hall and their red berries in the Autumn were a burden and a beauty and a Wonder Birds used to flock there I like birds even when they chatter and the r has enough to spare but the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at the trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it

          
          23:37:45
          then Orcs came with axes and cut down my trees I came and called them by their long names but they did not quiver they did not hear or answer they lay Dead Oh Oran oh Rowan Fair upon your hair how white the blossom lay oh Rowan mine I saw you shine upon a summer's day your rind so bright your leaves so light your voice so cool and soft upon your head how gold and red the crown you bore a loft oh Rowan head upon your head your hair is dry and gray your crown is spilled your voice is still forever and

          
          23:38:36
          day or the hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of balad that seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved the next day they spent also in his company but they did not go far from his house most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank for the wind was colder and the clouds were closer and grayer there was little sunshine and in the distance the voices of the ants at the moot still Rose and fell sometimes loud and strong sometimes low and sad sometimes quickening

          
          23:39:23
          sometimes slow and solemn as a durge a second night came and still the ants held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars the third day broke Bleak and windy at Sunrise the ant's voices Rose to a great clamor and then died down again as the morning wore on the Wind fell and the air grew heavy with expectancy the hobbits could see that bread was now listening intently although to them down in the Del of his end house the the sound of the moot was faint the afternoon came and the Sun going west towards the mountains sent

          
          23:40:04
          out long yellow beams between the cracks and fishes of the clouds suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet the whole Forest stood in listening Silence of course the antt voices had stopped what did that mean balad was standing up erect and tense looking back North Wards towards Dar Dingle then with a crash came a great ringing shout the trees quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them there was another pause and then a marching music began like solemn drums and above the rolling

          
          23:40:45
          beats and Booms there well voices singing high and strong we come we come with roll of drum to R run the r the ants were coming ever nearer and louder Rose their song we come we come with horn and drum bread picked up the hobbits and strolled from his house before long they saw the marching line approaching the ants were swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them tree beard was at their head and some 50 followers behind him two a breast keeping step with their feet and beating time with their hands

          
          23:41:28
          upon their flanks as they drew near The Flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen whom whom here we come with the boom here we come at last called Treebeard when he caught sight of balad and the hobbits come join the moot we are off we are off to Eisen guard to e andard the ants cried in many voices to ice and God to ice and God the I and God be ringed and barred with Doors of Stone though ice and guard be strong and hard as cold as Stone and be as bone we go we go we go to war to heue the stone and break the door for ball

          
          23:42:10
          and bow are burning now the furnace Roars we go to war to land of Gloom with of Doom with roll of drum we come we come to ice and God with doom we come with doom we come with Doom we come so they sang as they marched southwards brigad his eyes shining swung into the line beside Treebeard the old an now took the hobbits back and set them on his shoulders again and so they rode proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held high though they had expected something to happen eventually they were amazed at

          
          23:42:54
          the change that had come over the ant it seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dyke the anom made up their minds rather quickly after all didn't they Pippen ventured to say after some time when for a moment the singing paused and only the beating of hands and feet was heard quickly said tree beard yes indeed quicker than I expected indeed I have not seen them roused like this this for many an age we ants do not like being roused and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our

          
          23:43:33
          trees and our lives are in great danger that has not happened in this Forest since the wars of saurin and the men of the sea it is the orc work the want and hu rum without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires that has so angered us and the treachery of a neighbor who should have helped us Wizards ought to know better they do know better there is no curse in Elvish entish or the tongues of men bad enough for such treachery G with San will you really break the doors of Eisen guard asked Mary well we could you know you do not

          
          23:44:16
          know perhaps how strong we are maybe you have heard of trolls they are Mighty strong but trolls are counterfeits made by the enemy in the great darkness in mockery of ants as Orcs were of elves we are stronger than trolls we are made of the bones of the earth we can split Stones like the roots of trees only quicker far quicker if our minds are roused if we are not heun down or destroyed by fire or blast of sorcery we could split I andard into splinters and crack its walls into Rubble but saram man will try to stop you won't

          
          23:44:57
          he yes that is so I have not forgotten it indeed I have thought long about it but you see many of the ants are younger than I am by many lives of trees they are all roused now and their mind is all on one thing breaking e andard but they will start thinking again before long they will cool down a little when we take our evening drink what a thirst we shall have but let them March now and sing we have a long way to go and there is time ahead for thought it is something to have started tree beard marched on singing

          
          23:45:39
          with the others for a while but after a time his voice died to a murmur and felt silent again Pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted at last he looked up and Pippin could see a sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy there was a light in them as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark Wells of his thought of course it is likely enough my friends he said slowly likely enough that we are going to our Doom the last March of the an but if we stayed at home and did nothing

          
          23:46:15
          Doom would find us anyway sooner or later that thought has long been growing in our hearts and that is why we are Marching now it was not a Hasty resolve now at least the last March of the an may be worth a song I he side we may helped the other peoples before we pass away still I should have liked to see the songs come true about the ant wives I should dearly have liked to see F breel again but there my friends songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way and sometimes they are withered untimely

          
          23:46:56
          the ants went striding on at a great Pace they had descended into a long fold of the land that fell away Southward now they began to climb up and up onto the high Western Ridge the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups of birch and then to Bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine trees grew the sun sank behind the dark Hill back in front gray dusk fell Pippen looked behind mind the number of the ants had grown or what was happening where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie he thought

          
          23:47:35
          he saw Groves of trees but they were moving could it be that the Trees of fangor were awake and the forest was Rising marching over the hills to war he rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and Shadow had deceived him but the great gray shapes moved steadily onward there was a noise like wind in many branches the ants were Drawing Near the crest of the rid ra and all song had ceased night fell and there was silence nothing was to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the ants and a

          
          23:48:10
          rustle the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves at last they stood upon the summit and looked down into a dark pit the great Clift at the end of the mountains Nan the valley of Saran night Lies Over I and God said tree beard chapter 5 the white Rider my very bones are chilled said gimy flapping his arms and stamping his feet day had come at last at dawn the companions had made such breakfast as they could now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the

          
          23:49:02
          hobbits and do not forget that old man said gimy I should be happier if I could see the print of a boot why would that make you happy said Legolas because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he seemed answered the dwarf maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave no Prin here the grass is deep and springy that would not baffle a ranger said gimy a Bent Blade is enough for Aragon to read but I do not expect him to find any traces it was an evil Phantom of San that we saw last night I

          
          23:49:42
          am sure of it even under the light of morning his eyes are looking out on us from fangon even now maybe it is likely enough said Aragon yet I'm not sure I'm thinking of the horses you said last night gimy that they were scared away but I didn't think so did you hear them legus did they sound to you like beasts in Terror no said legus I heard them clearly but for the darkness and our own fear I should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness they spoke as Horses will when they meet a friend that

          
          23:50:20
          they have long missed so I thought said Aragon but I can't read the riddle unless they return come the light is growing fast let us look first and guess later we should begin here near to our own camping ground searching carefully all about and working up the slope towards the forest to find the hobbits is our erend whatever we may think of our visitor in the night if they escaped by some chance then they must have hidden in the trees or they would have been seen if we find nothing between here and the eaves of

          
          23:50:54
          the the wood then we'll make a last search upon the battlefield and among the ashes but there's little hope there the horsemen of row did their work too well for some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground the trees stood mournfully above them its dry leaves now hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wind Ador moved slowly away he came to the ashes of the watch far near the river bank and then began to retrace the ground back towards the null where the battle had been fought suddenly he stooped and bent low

          
          23:51:32
          with his face almost in the grass then he called to the others they came running up here at last we find news said Aragon he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see a large pale Leaf of Golden Hill now fading and turning brown here is a malor leaf of laurian and there are small crumb on it and a few more crumbs in the grass and see there are some pieces of cut cord lying nearby and here is the knife that cut them said gimy he stooped and Drew out of a Tusk into which some heavy footed trampled it a short Jagged Blade the

          
          23:52:13
          half from which it had been snapped was beside it it is an or weapon he said holding it gingerly and looking with disgust at the carved handle it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and learing mouth well here is the strangest riddle that we've yet found exclaimed legus a bound prisoner escapes both from the Orcs And from the surrounding Horsemen he then stops while still in the open and cuts his bonds with an orc knife but how and why for if his legs were tied how did he walk and if his arms were

          
          23:52:50
          tied how did he use the knife and if neither were tied why did he cut the cords at all being pleased with his skill he then sat down and quietly ate some wayy bread that at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit without the mow Lea after that I suppose he turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees it should be easy to find him we only need Wings ourselves there was sorcery here right enough said gimy what was that old man doing what have you to say Aragon to the reading of legus can you better it maybe

          
          23:53:29
          I could said Aragon smiling there is some other signs near at hand that you have not considered I agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free before he came here I guessed that it was hands because the riddle then becomes easier and also because as I read the marks he was carried to this point by an orc blood was spilled there a few Paces away orc blood that a deep Prince of hooves all about this spot and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away the orc was slain

          
          23:54:04
          by Horsemen and later his body was hauled to the fire but The Hobbit was not seen he was not in the open for it was night and he still had his Elven cloak he was exhausted and hungry and it's not to be wondered it but when he had cut his bonds with a knife of his Fallen enemy he rested and ate a little before he crept away but it's a comfort to know that he had some lmas in his pocket even though he ran away without gear or pack that perhaps is like a hobbit I say he though I hope and guess that both Mary and Pippen were here

          
          23:54:41
          together there is however nothing to show that for certain and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free asked gimy I don't know how it happened answered Aragorn nor do I know why an orc was carrying them away not to help them to escape we may be sure nay rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning why when bmir had fallen with the Orcs content with the capture of Mary and Pippen they didn't seek out the rest of us nor attack our camp but instead they

          
          23:55:19
          went with all speed towards Eisen guard did they suppose that they had captured the ring bearer and his faithful comrades I think not their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to Orcs even if they knew so much themselves they would not speak openly to them of the Ring they're not trusty servants but I think the Orcs had been commanded to capture Hobbits alive at all costs an attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle treachery perhaps likely enough with some folk some large and

          
          23:55:53
          bold orc may have been trying to escape with the prize alone for his own ends there that's my tale others might be devised but on this we may count in any case one at least of our friends escaped it's our task to find him and help him before we returned to Rohan we must not be daunted by fangor since need drove him into that dark place I don't know which taunts me more fangon or the thought of the long road through Rowan on foot said gimy then let us go to the forest said Aragon it wasn't long before Aragon

          
          23:56:34
          found fresh signs at one point near the bank of the anent wash He Came Upon Footprints Hobbit Prints but too light for much to be made of them then again beneath the bowl of a great Tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered the Earth was Bare and and dry and didn't reveal much one Hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back and then it turned away into the forest said Aragorn then we must go in too said gimy but I don't like the look of this fangor and we were warned against it I wish the

          
          23:57:15
          Chase had led anywhere else I don't think the wood feels evil whatever Tales may say said Legolas he stood under the e of the forest stooping forward as if he were listening and peering with wide eyes into the Shadows no it's not evil or what evil is in it is far away I catch Only The faintest Echoes of dark places where the hearts of the trees are black There is No Malice near us but there is watchfulness and anger well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimy I've done it no harm that's just as well said legus but nonetheless

          
          23:57:58
          it has suffered harm there is something happening inside or going to happen do you not feel the tenseness it takes my breath I feel the air is stuffy said the dwarf this wood is lighter than MK wood but it's musty and chabby it's old very old said the elf so old that almost I feel young again as I have not felt since I journeyed with your children it's old and full of memory I could have been happy here if I'd come in days of peace I dare say you could snorted gimy you're a Wood Elf anyway though elves of any kind of

          
          23:58:40
          strange folk yet you comfort me where you go I'll go but keep your bow ready to hand and I'll keep my axe loose in my belt not for use on trees he added hastily looking up at the the tree under which they stood I don't wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand that's all let's go with that the three Hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn Legolas and gim left the tracking to Aragon there was little for him to see the floor of the forest was dry and covered with a

          
          23:59:18
          drift of leaves but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water he returned often to the banks of the stream so it was that he came upon the place where Mary and Pippen had drunk and bathed their feet there plain for all to see were the footprints of two Hobbits one somewhat smaller than the other this is good tidings said Aragon yet the marks are two days old and it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water side then what should we do now said gimy we can't pursue the through the whole fastness of

          
          23:59:56
          funon we've come ill supplied if we don't find them soon we should be of no use to them except to sit down beside them and show our friendship by starving together if that's indeed all we can do then we must do it said Aron let us go on they came at length to the Steep abrupt end of treebeard's Hill and looked up at the rock wall with its rough steps leading to the high Shelf gleams of sun Were Striking through the hurting clouds and the forest now looked less gray and rear let us go up and look about us said

          
          24:00:35
          Legolas I still feel my breath short the companions climbed up Aragorn came last moving slowly he was scanning the steps and Ledges closely I'm almost sure that the hobbits have been up here he said but there are other marks very strange marks which I don't understand I wonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess which way they went next he stood up and looked about but he saw nothing that was of any use the Shelf faced Southward and Eastward but only on the East was the view open there he

          
          24:01:16
          could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards the plain from which they had come we've journeyed a long way round said legalis we could have all come here safe together if we'd left the Great River on the second or third day and struck West few can foresee whether their Road will lead them till they come to its end but we didn't wish to come to funon said gimy yet here we are and nicely caught in the net said Legolas look look at what said gimy there in the trees where I've not alies hush speak more

          
          24:01:55
          softly look said Legas pointing down in the wood back in the way that we've just come it is he cannot you see him passing from tree to tree I see I see him now his skimy look Aragon did I not warn you there's the old man all in dirty gray Rags that's why I couldn't see him at first Aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly it wasn't far away it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a rough staff his head was bowed and he didn't look towards them in other lands they would

          
          24:02:36
          have greeted him with kind words but now they stood silent each feeling a strange expectancy something was approaching that held a hidden power or Menace gimle gazed with wide eyes for a while as step by step the figure Drew nearer then then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out your bow Legas bend it get ready it's San do not let him speak or put a spell upon us shoot first legus took his bow and bent it slowly and as if some other will resisted him he held an arrow Loosely in

          
          24:03:14
          his hand but did not fit it to the string Aragorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent why are you waiting what's the matter with you said gimy in a hissing whisper legus is Right Said Aragon quietly we may not shoot an old man so at unawares and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us watch and wait at that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock wall then suddenly he looked up while they stood motionless looking down there was no

          
          24:03:50
          sound they couldn't see his face he was hooded and above the hood he wore a wide brimmed hat so that all his features were overshadowed except for the end of his nose and his Gray beard yet it seemed to Aragorn that he caught The Gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows at last the old man broke the silence well met indeed my friends he said in a soft voice I wish to speak to you will you come down or shall I come up without waiting waiting for an answer he began to climb now said gimy stop him

          
          24:04:29
          legus did I not see that I wish to speak to you said the old man put away that bow Master elf the bow and arrow fell from legolas's hands and his arms hung loose at his sides and you master dwarf pray take your hand from your axe half till I'm up you will not need such arguments gimy started and then stood still a stone staring while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat all Weir seemed to have left him as he stepped up onto the Shelf there was a gleam too brief for certainty a quick

          
          24:05:07
          glint of white as if some garment shrouded by the gray Rags had been for an instant revealed the intake of gim's breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence well met I say again said the old man coming towards them when he was a few feet away he stood stooping over his staff with his head thrust forward peering at them from under his hood and what may you be doing in these parts an elf a man and a dwarf all claring Elish fashion no doubt there's a tale worth hearing behind it all such things are not often seen

          
          24:05:46
          here you speak as one who knows fangon well said Aragon is that so not well said the old man that would be the study of many lives but I come here now and again may we know your name and then hear what it is that you have to say to us said Aragon the morning passes and we have an errand that will not wait as for what I wished to say I've said it what may you be doing and what tale can you tell of yourselves as for my name he broke off laughing long and softly Aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound a strange cold

          
          24:06:28
          thrill and yet it was not fear or Terror that he felt rather it was like the sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of cold rain that wakes up an uneasy sleeper my name said the old man again have you not guessed it already you've heard it before I think yes you've heard it before but come now what of your tail the three companions stood silent and made no answer there are some who' begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to tell said the old man happily I know something of it you are tracking the

          
          24:07:05
          footsteps of two young Hobbits I believe yes Hobbits don't stare as if you'd never heard the strange name before you have and so have I well they climbed up here the day before yesterday and they met someone they didn't expect does that comfort you and now you'd like to know where they were taken well well maybe I can give you some news about that but why are we standing your errand you see is no longer as urgent as you thought let us sit down and be more at ease the old man turned away and went

          
          24:07:43
          towards a heap of Fallen stones and rock at the foot of the cliff behind immediately as if a spell had been removed the others relaxed and stirred G hand went at once to his ax half Adon drew his sword legus picked up his bow the old man took no notice but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stone then his gray cloak Drew apart and they saw Beyond doubt that he was clothed beneath all in White San cried gimy springing towards him with ax in hand speak tell us where you've hidden our friends what

          
          24:08:21
          have you done with them speak or I will make a dent in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal with the old man was too quick for him he sprang to his feet and leapt to the top of a large Rock there he stood grown suddenly tall towering above them his hood and his gray Rags were flung away his white garments Shone he lifted up his staff and gim's axe leapt from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground the sword of Aragorn stiff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden far legus gave

          
          24:08:59
          a great shout and shot an arrow high in the air it vanished in a flash of flame mytha he cried mytha well met I say to you again gorus said the old man they all gazed at him his hair was white as snow in the sunshine and gleaming white was his robe His Eyes under his deep brows were bright piercing as the rays of the sun power was in his hand between Wonder joy and fear they stood and found no words to say at last Aragon stirred gandal he said beyond all hope you return to us in our need what veil

          
          24:09:42
          was over my sight Gandalf gimy said nothing but sank to his knees shading his eyes gandal the old man repeated as if recalling from old memory a long disused word yes that was my name I was gandal he stepped down from the Rock and picking up his gray cloak wrapped it about him it seemed as if the sun had been shining but now was hidden Cloud again yes you may still call me gandal he said and the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide get up my good gimly no blame to you and no harm done to me indeed my friends none of you

          
          24:10:25
          have any weapons that could hurt me be merry we meet again at the turn of the tide the great storm is coming but the tide has turned he laid his hand on gim's head and the dwarf looked up and laughed suddenly gandal he said but you're all in white yes I am white now said Gandalf indeed I am San one might almost say San as he should have been but come now tell me of yourselves I passed through fire and deep water since we parted I forgotten much that I thought I knew and learned again much that I had forgotten I can see many

          
          24:11:05
          things far off but many things that are close at hand I cannot see tell me of yourselves what do you wish to know said Aragon all that has happened since we parted on the bridge would be a long tale won't you first give us news of the hobbits did you find them and they safe no I didn't find them said Gandalf there was a Darkness Over The Valleys of the am mu but I did not know of their captivity until the eagle told me the eagle said legalis I've seen an eagle high and far off the last time was 3

          
          24:11:42
          days ago above the EM moil yes said Gandalf that was gu here the windl who rescued me from orank I sent him before me to watch the river and gather Tidings his sight is Keen but he can't see all that passes under Hill and tree some things he has seen and others I've seen myself the ring now has passed beyond my help or the help of any of the company that set out from rivendale very nearly it was revealed to the enemy but it escaped I had some part in that for I sat in a high place and I strove with a

          
          24:12:19
          Dark Tower and the shadow passed then I was weary very weary and I walked long in dark thought then you know about Frodo said gimy how do things go with him I can't say he was saved from a great Peril but many lie before him still he resolved to go alone to Mordor and he set out that is all that I can say not alone said legus we think that Sam went with him did he said Gandalf and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face did he indeed it is news to me yet it doesn't surprise me good very good you

          
          24:13:02
          lighten my heart you must tell me more now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey the companion sat on the ground at his feet and Aragon took up the tail for a long while Gandalf said nothing and he asked no questions his hands were spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed at last when Aragon spoke of the death of bmir and of his last journey upon the Great River the old man side you have not said all that you know or guess Aragon my friend he said quietly poor bmir I couldn't see what happened to him

          
          24:13:43
          it was a sore trial for such a man a warrior and a lord of men gadriel told me that he was in Peril but he escaped in the end I am glad it was not in vain that the young Hobbits came with us if only for boromir's sake but that's not the only part they have to play they were brought to fangor and their coming was like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains even as we talk here I hear the first Rumblings San had best not be caught away from home when the dam bursts in one thing you've not changed

          
          24:14:20
          my dear friend said Aragon you still speak in riddles what in riddles said Gandalf no but I was talking aloud to myself a habit of the old they choose the wisest person present to speak to the long explanations needed by the younger wearing he laughed but the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine I'm no longer young even in the Reckoning of men of the ancient houses said Aragon won't you open your mind more clearly to me what then should I say said Gandalf and paused for a while in

          
          24:14:56
          thought this in brief is how I see things at the moment if you wish to have a piece of my mind as plain as possible the enemy of course has long known that the ring is abroad and that it's born by a hobbit he knows now the number of our company that set out from rivendale and the kind of each of us but it doesn't yet perceive our purpose clearly he supposes that we were all going to minth for that is what he would himself have done in our place and according to his wisdom it would have been a heavy stroke

          
          24:15:31
          against his power indeed he's in great fear not knowing what mighty one may suddenly appear wielding the ring and assailing him with war seeking to cast him down and take his place that we should wish to cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that occurs to his mind that we should try to destroy the ring itself has not yet entered into his darkest dream in which no doubt you will see our good fortune and our hopes for imagining War he has let loose War believing that he has no

          
          24:16:05
          time to waste for he that strikes the first blow if he strikes it hard enough may need to strike no more so the forces that he has long been preparing he is now setting in motion sooner than he intended Wise Fool For if he had used all his power to guard moreor so that none could enter and bent all his guile to the hunting of the Ring then indeed hope would have faded neither ring nor be could long have eluded him but now his eye gazes abroad rather than near at home and mostly he looks towards Min

          
          24:16:41
          tith very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm for already he knows that The Messengers that he sent to whay the company have failed again they have not found the ring neither have they brought away any Hobbits as hostages had they done even so much as that it would have been a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal but let us not darken Our Hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the Dark Tower for the enemy has failed so far thanks to San then is not Saran a traitor said

          
          24:17:20
          gimy indeed yes said Gandalf doubly and is not that strange nothing that we have endured of late has seemed so Grievous as the treason of Eisen guard even reckoned as a Lord and Captain Saron has grown very strong he threatens the men of Rohan and draws off their help from minth even as the main blow is approaching from the East yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand Saron also had a mind to capture the ring for himself or at least to snare some Hobbits for his evil purposes so between them our enemies

          
          24:17:58
          have contrived only to bring Mary and Pippen with marvelous speed and in the nick of time to fangon where otherwise they would never have come at all also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans no Tidings of the battle will come to Mordor thanks to the Horseman of Rohan but the Dark Lord knows that two Hobbits were taken in the EM mu and borne away towards eard against the will of his own servants he now has Eisen guard to fear as well as minth if minth falls it will

          
          24:18:34
          go ill with Saron it is a Pity that our friends lie in between said gimy if no land divided Eisen guard and Mordor then they could fight while we watched and waited the victory would emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said Gandalf but Eis andard cannot fight Mordor unless Saron first obtains the ring that he will never do now he doesn't yet know his Peril there's much that he doesn't know he was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he couldn't wait at home and he came forth to meet and to spy on his Messengers but

          
          24:19:13
          he came too late for once and the battle was over and Beyond his help before he reached these parts he did not remain here long I look in into his mind and I see his doubt he has no Woodcraft he believes that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle but he doesn't know whether the Orcs were bringing any prisoners or not and he doesn't know of the quaddle between his servants and the Orcs of Mordor nor does he know of the winged messenger the winged messenger cried Legolas I shot at

          
          24:19:47
          him with a bow of gadriel above San gber and I filed him from the sky he filled us all with fear what new terror is this one that you cannot slay with arrows said Gandalf you only slew his Steed it was a good deed but the rider was soon horsed again for he was a Nazgul one of the nine who ride now upon winged steeds soon their Terror will overshadow the last armies of our friends cutting off the Sun but they have not yet been allowed to cross the river and Salamon doesn't know of this new shape in which

          
          24:20:24
          the ring Rays have been clad his thought is ever on the ring was it present in the battle was it found what if Theoden Lord of The Mark should come by it and learn of its power that's the danger that he sees and he has fled back to Eisen guard to double and treble his assault on Rohan and all the time there is another danger close at hand which he doesn't see busy with his fiery thoughts he has forgotten tree beard now you speak to yourself again said Aragon with a smile tree bear is not known to me and I've guessed part of

          
          24:21:01
          salamon's double treachery yet I don't see in what way the coming of two Hobbits to fangor is served safe to give us a long and fruitless Chase wait a minute cried gimy there's another thing that I should like to know first was it you Gandalf or san that we saw last night you certainly didn't see me answered Gandalf therefore I must guess that you saw Saron evidently we look so much alike that your desire to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused good good said gimy I'm glad that it wasn't you gandal laughed again

          
          24:21:40
          yes my good dwarf he said it's a comfort not to be mistaken at all points do I not know it only too well but of course I never blamed you for your welcome of me how could I do so who've so often counseled my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the Enemy bless you gimy son of glin maybe you will see us both together one day and judge between us but the hobbits Legas broke in we've come far to seek them and you seem to know where they are where are they now with treebird and the Ants said

          
          24:22:18
          Gandalf the ants exclaimed Aragon then there's true Ruth and the old legends about the Dwellers in the Deep forests and the giant Shepherds of the trees are there still ants in the world I thought they were only a memory of ancient days if indeed they were ever more than a legend of Rohan a legend of Rohan cried Legolas nay every elf in wilderland has sung songs of the old on odm and their long sorrow yet even among us there only a memory if I were to meet one still walking in this world then indeed I

          
          24:22:53
          should feel young again but tree beard that is only a rendering of Fung Gorn into the common speech yet you seem to speak of a person who is this tree beard ah now you are asking much said Gandalf the little that I know of his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now tree beard is fangor the guardian of the forest he is the oldest of the ants the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the sun upon this Middle Earth I hope indeed legus that you may yet meet him Mary and

          
          24:23:31
          Pippen have been fortunate they met him here even where we sit for he came here 2 days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains he often comes here especially when his mind is uneasy and the rumors of the world outside trouble him I saw him 4 days ago striding among the trees and I think he saw me for he paused but I didn't speak for I was Heavy with thought and weary after my struggle with the eye of Mordor and he didn't speak either nor Call My Name perhaps he also

          
          24:24:08
          thought that you were San said gim but you speak of him as if he was a friend I thought fangon was dangerous dangerous cried Gandalf and so am I very dangerous more dangerous than anything you will ever meet unless you're brought alive before the seat of the dark lord and Aragon is dangerous and legus is dangerous you are beset with dangers gimly son of gloin for you are dangerous yourself in your own fashion certainly the forest of funon is perilous not least to those that are too ready with their axes and funon himself

          
          24:24:47
          he is perilous too yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless but now his long slow wroth is brimming over and all the forest is filled with it the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they have brought have spilled it it will soon be running like a flood but its tide is turned against San and the axes of Eisen guard a thing is about to happen which has not happened since the Elder days the ants are going to wake up and find that they are strong what will they do asked lias in astonishment I don't know said Gandalf I

          
          24:25:25
          don't think they know themselves I wonder he fell silent his head bowed and thought the others looked at him a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on his hands which lay now upturned on his lap they seemed to be filled with light as a cup is with water at last he looked up and gazed straight at the Sun the morning is wearing away he said soon we must go do you go to find our friends and to see tree bird asked Aragon no said Gandalf that's not the road that you must take I've spoken words of Hope but

          
          24:26:08
          only of hope hope is not Victory war is upon us and all our friends a war in which only the use of the Ring could give us shity of Victory it fills me with great sorrow and great fear for much will be destroyed and all may be lost I am gandal Gandalf the White but black is mightier still he rose and gazed out Eastward shading his eyes as if he saw things far away that none of them could see then he shook his head no he said in a soft voice it has gone beyond our reach of that at least let us be glad we can no longer be tempted to

          
          24:26:49
          use the ring we must go down to face a pedal near despair yet that deadly Peril is removed he turned come Aragorn son of arthorn he said don't regret your choice in the Valley of the EM wield nor call it a vain Pursuit you chose amid doubts the path that seemed right the choice was just and it has been rewarded but so we've met in time who otherwise might have met too late but the quest of your companions is over your next journey is marked by your given word you must go to edas and seek out Theoden his hall for

          
          24:27:30
          you are needed the light of anduril must now be uncovered in the battle for which it has so long waited there is war in Rohan and worse evil it goes ill with thein then are we not to see the merry young Hobbits again said legus I didn't say so said Gandalf who knows have patience go where you must go and hope to edor us I go thither also it is a long way for a man to walk young or old said argon I fear the battle will be over long a I come there we shall see we shall see said Gandalf will you come now with me yes we'll set

          
          24:28:14
          out together said Aragon but I don't doubt that you'll come there before me if you wish he rose and looked long at G and Alf the others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one another the gray figure of the man Aragon son of arthorn was tall and Stern as Stone his hand upon the hilt of his sword he looked as if some King out of the mids of the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men before him stooped the old figure white shining now as if with some Light kindled Within bent

          
          24:28:50
          Laden with years but holding a beyond the strength of Kings do I not say truly Gandalf said Aragon at last that you could go with soever you wished quicker than I and this I also say you are our captain and our Banner the dark lord has nine but we have one mightier than they the white Rider he has passed through the fire in the abyss and they shall fear him we'll go where he leads yes together we will follow you said Legolas but first it would ease my heart Gandalf to hear what befell you in Moria will

          
          24:29:29
          you not tell us can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered I've stayed already too long answered Gandalf time is short but if there were a year to spend I wouldn't tell you all then tell us what you will and time allows said gimy come Gandalf tell us how you fed with a bog name him not said Gandalf and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face and he sat silent looking old as death long time I fell he said at last slowly as if thinking back with difficulty long I

          
          24:30:12
          fell and he fell with me his fire was about me I was burned then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark cold it was as the tide of death almost it froze my heart deep is the abyss that is span by during's bridge and none has measured it said gim yet it has a bottom Beyond light and knowledge said Gandalf thither I came at last to the uttermost foundations of stone he was with me still his fire was quenched but now he was a thing of slime stronger than a strangling snake we fought far under the Living Earth

          
          24:30:55
          where time is not counted ever he clutched me and ever I heed him till at last he fled into dark tunnels they were not made by Duran's folk gimly son of gloin far far below the deepest delvings of the dwarves the world is gored by nameless things even Sauron knows them not they are older than he now I have walked there but I will bring no report ought to darken the light of day in that despair my enemy was my only hope and I pursued him clutching at his heel thus he brought me back at last to the secret

          
          24:31:34
          ways of kazad Doom too well he knew them all ever up now we went until we came to the endless stair long has that been lost said gimy many have said that it was never made save in Legend but others say that it was destroyed it was made and it had not been destroyed said Gandalf from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed ascending an unbroken spiral in many thousand steps until it issued at last in Doran carved in the living Rock of Zer zigel the Pinnacle of the silvertine there upon cbil was a lonely

          
          24:32:19
          window in the snow and before it a narrow space a dizzy iy Above The Mists of the world the sun shot fiercely there but all below was wrapped in Cloud out he sprang and ever as I came behind he burst into flame there was none to see or perhaps in after Ages songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak suddenly Gandalf laughed but what would they say in song those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with the Storm Thunder they heard and lightning they said smote upon

          
          24:32:58
          cbil and leaped back broken into tongues ofar is that not enough a great smoke Rose about us vapor and steam ice fell like rain I threw down my enemy and he fell from the high place and broke the mountain side where he smote it in his ruin then Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time and I wanded far on roads that I will not tell naked I was sent back for a brief time until my task is done and naked I lay upon the Mountaintop the tower behind was crumbled into dust the window was gone

          
          24:33:39
          the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken Stone I was alone forgotten without Escape upon the hard horn of the world there I lay staring upward while the Stars wheeled over and each day was as long as a life age of the Earth faint to my ears came the gathered rumor of all lands the springing and the dying the song of the Weeping and the slow Everlasting groan of overburdened stone and so at the last gu here the windl found me again and he took me up and Bore Me Away ever am I fated to be your burden

          
          24:34:19
          friend at need I said a burden you have been he answered but not so now light as a Swan's feather in my claw you are the sun shines through you indeed I do not think you need me anymore were I to let you fall you would float upon the wind do not let me fall I gasped for I felt life in me again bear me to looran that indeed is the command of the lady gadriel who sent me to look for you he answered thus it was that I came to caras gathon and found you but lately gone I tered there in the Ageless time

          
          24:34:58
          of that land where days bring healing not Decay healing I found and I was clothed in white counsel I gave and counil took then by strange roads I came and messages I bring to some of you to Aragon I was bidden to say this where now are the dunad elisar elisar why do the kins folk wander AAR near as they are when the Lost should come forth and the great company ride from the north but dark is the path appointed for thee the dead watch the road that leads to the sea to Legolas she sent this word Legolas Green Leaf long under tree

          
          24:35:46
          in Joy thou Hast lived Beware of the sea if thou hearest The Cry of the the G on the shore thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more gandal fell silent and shut his eyes then she sent me no message said gimy and bent his head dark are her words said Legolas and little do they mean to those that receive them that is no Comfort said gimy what then said Legolas would you have her speak openly to you of your death yes if she had not else to say what is that said Gandalf opening his eyes yes I think I can guess what

          
          24:36:30
          her Words May mean your pardon kimy I was pondering the messages once again but indeed she sent words to you and neither dark nor said to gimly son of Glo she said give his ladies greeting lock Bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee but have a care to lay thine ax to the right Tree in happy hour you've returned to us Gandalf cried the dwarf capering as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf tongue come come he shouted swinging his ax since Gandalf's head is now sacred let us find one that is right to

          
          24:37:11
          cleave that will not be far to seek said Gandalf rising from his seat come we've spent all the time that's allowed to a meeting of parted friends now that there is need of haste he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak and led the way following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way back through the forest down the bank of the anash they spoke no more words until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn there was no sign of their horses to be

          
          24:37:45
          seen they have not returned said legalis it will be a weary walk I shall not walk time presses said Gandalf then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle so clear and piercing was the note that the others stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips three times he whistled and then faint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the Winnie of a horse borne up from the plains upon the Eastern wind they waited wondering before long there came the sound of hooves at first hardly more than a

          
          24:38:22
          Tremor of the ground perceptible only to Aragon as he lay upon the grass then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat there is more than one horse coming said Aragon certainly said Gandalf we are too great a burden for one there are three said Legolas gazing out over the plane see how they run there is hael and there is my friend arod beside him but there is is another that strides ahead a very great horse I have not seen his like before no will you again said Gandalf that is shadowfax he is the

          
          24:39:01
          chief of the meus Lords of horses and not even theodon king of Rowan has ever looked on a better does he not shine like silver and run as smoothly as a swift stream he has come for me the horse of the white Rider we're going to battle together even as the old witard spoke the great horse came striding up the slope towards them his coat was glistening and his man flowing in the Wind of his speed the two others followed now far behind as soon as shadowax saw Gandalf he checked his pace and wined loudly then trotting gently

          
          24:39:39
          forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils under the old man's neck gandaf caressed him it's a long way from rivendale my friend he said but you are wise and Swift and come at need far let us Ride Now together and part not in this world again soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by as if awaiting orders we go at once to meow seld the Hall of your master Theoden said Gandalf addressing them Gravely they bowed their heads time presses so with your leave my friends we will ride we beg you to use

          
          24:40:19
          all the speed that you can h arel shall bear Aragon and arod Legolas I will sit gimly before me and by his leave Shadow shall bear us both we will wait now only to drink a little now I understand a part of last night's riddle said legus as he sprang lightly Upon Our Rod's back whether they fled at first in fear or not our horses met shadowfax their Chieftain and greeted him with joy did you know that he was at hand Gandalf yes I knew said the wizard I bent my thought upon Him bidding him to make haste for

          
          24:40:56
          yesterday he was far away in the south of this land swiftly may he bear me back again gandal spoke now to shadowx and the horse set off at a good Pace but yet not beyond the measure of the others after a little while he turned suddenly and choosing a place where the banks were lower he waited the river and then LED them away due south into a flat land treeless and wide the wind went like gray waves through the endless miles of grass there was no sign of road or track but shadowfax did not stay or

          
          24:41:30
          falter he's steering a straight course now for the hills of Theoden under the slopes of the White Mountains said Gandalf it will be quicker so the ground is firmer in the East emnet where the chief northward track lies across the river but shadowax knows the way through every Fin and Hollow for many hours they rode on through the Meades and riverlands often the grass was so high that it reached above the knees of the Riders and their steeds seemed to be swimming in a gray green sea They Came Upon many hidden pools and Broad Acres

          
          24:42:05
          of sge waving above wet and treacherous bogs but shadowfax found the way and the other horses followed in his sth slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the West looking out over the Great Plain far away the Riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red upon either side a smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun's disc to the Hue of blood as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of Earth there lies the gap of Rohan said

          
          24:42:42
          Gandalf it is now almost Due West of us that way lies eard I see a great smoke said legus what may that be battle and War said Gandalf ride on chapter six the king of the golden Hall they rode on through Sunset and slow Dusk and gathering night when at last they halted and dismounted even Aragon was stiff and weary Gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest let Legolas and gimly slept and Aragon lay flat stretched upon his back but Gandalf stood leaning on his star gazing into the darkness East and West All was

          
          24:43:33
          silent and there was no sign or sound of living thing the night was barred with long clouds fleeting on a chill wind when they arose again under the cold Moon they went on once more as Swift as By the Light of Day hours passed and still they rode on gimlin nodded and would have fallen from his seat if Gandalf had not clutched and shaken him Huell and arod weary but proud followed their tireless leader a gray Shadow before them hardly to be seen the miles went by the waxing moon sank into the Cloudy

          
          24:44:13
          West a bitter chill came into the air slowly in the East the dark faded to a cold gray red shafts of light leapt above the Black Walls of the am mu far away upon their left Dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across their path rushing through the bent grasses suddenly shadowa Stood Still and nade Gandalf pointed ahead look he cried and they lifted their tired eyes before them stood the mountains of the South white tipped and stre with black the grasslands rooll red against the hills that clustered at their feet and flowed

          
          24:44:55
          up into many valleys still dim and dark Untouched by the light of dawn winding their way into the heart of the great mountains immediately before The Travelers the widest of these glends opened like a Long Gulf amid the hills far inward they glimpsed a tumbled Mountain Mass with one tall Peak at the mouth of the veil there stood like a sentinel a lonely height about out its feet there flowed as a thread of silver the stream that issued from the Dale upon its brow they caught still far away a glint in the Rising Sun a glimmer of

          
          24:45:33
          gold speak legus said Gandalf tell us what you see there before us Legolas gazed ahead shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new Risen Sun I see a white stream that comes down from the Snows he said where did it from the shadow of the veil a Green Hill Rises upon the East a dyke and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it within there Rise the rooves of houses and in the midst set upon a green Terrace there stands a loft a great hall of men and it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold the light of it shines far

          
          24:46:14
          over the land golden too are the posts of its doors there men in bright males stand but all else within the courts are yet asleep edas those courts are called said gandal and medel is that golden Hall there dwells Theoden son of thel King of the mark of Rohan we have come with the rising of the day now the road lies plain to see before us but we must ride more weily for war is abroad and the O hear him the horse Lords do not sleep even if it seems so from afar draw no weapon speak no hay word I counsel you

          
          24:46:58
          all until we are come before theoden's seat the morning was bright and clear about them and birds were singing When The Travelers came to the stream it ran down swiftly into the plain and Beyond the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide Bend flowing away East to feed the wash far off in its Reed choked beds the land was Green in the wet Meades and along the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow trees already in this southern land they were blushing red at their fingertips feeling the approach of

          
          24:47:37
          spring over the stream there was a Ford between low Banks much trampled by the passage of Horses The Travelers passed over and Came Upon a wide rotted track leading towards the Uplands at the foot of the walled Hill the way ran under the shadow of many Mounds high in green upon their Western sides the grass was white as with a drifted snow small flowers sprang there like countless Stars amid the turf look said Gandalf how fair are the bright eyes in the grass ever mind they are called symol meon in this land of men for they

          
          24:48:18
          blossom in all the seasons of the year and grow where dead men rest behold we have come to the great bows where the SS of Theoden sleep seven Mounds upon the left and nine upon the Right Said Aragon many long lives of men it is since the golden Hall was built 500 times have the Red Leaves fallen in merkwood in my home since then said Legolas and but a little while does that seem to us but to the Riders of the mark it seems so long ago said Aragon that the raising of this house is but a memory of song and the years before are

          
          24:48:56
          lost in the midst of time now they call this land their home their own and their speeches suered from the northern kin then he began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf yet they listened for there was a strong music in it that I guess is the language of the roim said Legolas for it is like to this land itself rich and rolling in part and else hard and Stern as the mountains but I cannot guess what it means save that it is Laden with the sadness of mortal speech it runs thus in

          
          24:49:32
          the common speech said Aragon as near as I can make it where now the horse and the rider where is the horn that was blowing where is the helm and the harok and the bright hair flowing where is the hand on the harpstring and the red fire glowing where where is the spring and the Harvest and the tall corn growing they have passed Like Rain On The Mountain like a wind in the medow the days have gone down in the west behind the hills into Shadow Who Shall Gather the smoke of the Dead wood burning or

          24:50:48
          barred the way with Spears stay strangers here unknown they cried in the tongue of the ridar demanding the names and errand of the strangers Wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness as they looked Darkly upon Gandalf well do I understand your speech he answered in the same language yet few strangers do so why then do you not speak in the common tongue as is the custom in the west if you wish to be answered it is the will of Theoden King that none should enter his Gates save those who know our tongue and are our

          
          24:51:24
          friends replied one of the Gods none are welcome here in days of War but our own folk and those that come from mundor in the land of Gondor who are you that come heedless over the plains thus strangely clad riding horses like to our own horses long have we kept guard here and we've watched you from afar never have we seen other Riders so strange nor any horse more proud than is one of these that bear you he is one of the meas unless our eyes are cheated by some spill say are you not a wizard some spy

          24:52:41
          if what you tell me is truth then doubtless Theoden will have heard of it maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked for it's but two nights ago that worm Tong came to us and said that by the will of theodan No Stranger should pass these Gates wormtongue said Gandalf looking sharply at the guard say no more my errand is not to worm Tong but to the Lord of The Mark himself I am in haste will you not go or send to say that we are come His Eyes glinted under his deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the

          
          24:53:16

          24:54:35
          bear be it only a star you must leave on the threshold the door wardens will keep them the dark gates were swung open The Travelers entered walking in file behind their guide they found a broad path paved with Hune Stones now winding upward now climbing in short flights of well- laid steps many houses built of wood and many dark doors they passed beside the way in a stone Channel a stream of clear water flowed sparkling and chattering at length they came to the crown of the Hill there stood a high

          
          24:55:12
          platform upon a green Terrace at the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a stone carved in the likeness of a horse's head beneath was a wide Basin from which the water spilled and fed the falling stream up the green Terrace went a stair of Stone High and Broad and on either side of the topmost step were Stone Hune seats there sat other guards with drawn swords laid upon their knees their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun was blazed upon their green Shields their long corsets were

          
          24:55:45
          burnished bright and when they Rose taller they seemed than mortal men there are the doors before you said the guide I must return now to my duty at the gate farewell and may the lord of the mark be gracious to you he turned and went swiftly back down the road the others climbed the long stair under the eyes of the tall Watchmen silent they stood now above and spoke no word until Gandalf stepped out upon the paved Terrace at the stairs head then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courtious

          
          24:56:21
          greeting in their own tongue hail comers from afar they said and they turned the hilts of their swords toward the Travelers in token of Peace green gems flashed in the sunlight then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech I am the door ward of Theoden he said hmer is my name here I must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter then legus gave into his hand his silver halfed knife his quiver and his bow keep these well he said for they come from the golden wood and the lady

          24:57:35
          Gondor this is the house of Theoden not of Aragon even were he king of Gondor in the seat of denior said hmer stepping swiftly before the doors and baring the way his sword was now in his hand and the Point toward the strangers this is Idle talk said Gandalf needless is theon's demand but it is useless to refuse a king will have his way in his own Hall be it folly or wisdom truly said Aragon and I would do as the Master of the House B me were this only a Woodman's cot if I bore now any sword but

          24:58:53
          elves made it long ago now let me pass come Aragorn slowly Aragon unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword upright against the wall here I set it he said but I command you not to touch it nor to permit any other to lay hand on it in this Elish sheath dwells the blade that was broken and has been made again tell half first dra it in the deeps of time Death Shall come to any man that draws a lel's sword save a lel's Heir the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on Aragon it seems that you have come on

          the wings of song out of the Forgotten days he said it shall be Lord as you command well said gimy if it has Ural to keep it company my axee may stay here too without shame and he laid it on the floor now then if all is As You Wish let us go and speak with your master the guard still hesitated your staff he said to Gandalf forgive me but that too must be left at the doors foolishness said Gandalf Prudence is one thing but disc courtesy is another I am old if I may not lean on my stick as I go then I will sit out

          
          25:00:16
          here until it PES theodon to hobble out himself to speak with me Aragon laughed every man has something too dear to trust to another but would you part an old man from his support come will you not let us enter the staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age said hmer he looked hard at the ashar on which Gandalf leaned yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom I believe your friends and folk worthy of honor who have no evil purpose you may go in the guards now lifted the heavy

          bars of the doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hindes The Travelers entered inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill the hall was long and wide and filled with shadows and half lights Mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof but here and there Bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts from the Eastern Windows High under the Deep Eve through the Lou in the roof above the thin wisps of issuing smoke the sky showed pale and blue as their eyes changed The Travelers perceived that the

          
          25:01:32
          floor was paved with stones of many Hues branching runes and strange devices intertwined beneath their feet they saw now that the pillars were richly carved gleaming dully with gold and half seen colors many woven cloths were hung upon the walls and over their wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend some dim with ears some darkening in the shade but upon one form the sunlight fell a young man upon a white horse he was blowing a Great Horn and his yellow hair was flying in the wind the horse's

          was a great gilded chair upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circlet set upon his brow in the center upon his forehead shown a single white diamond his beard was laid like snow upon his knees but his eyes still burned with a bright light glinting as he gazed at the strangers behind his chair stood a woman in white At His Feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a man with a pale

          
          25:03:25
          wise face and heavy lied eyes there was a silence the old man did not move in his chair at length Gandalf spoke hail Theoden son of thel I have returned for behold the storm comes and now all friends should gather together lest each singly be destroyed slowly the old man Rose to his feet leaning heavily upon a short black staff with a handle of white bone and now the strangers saw that bent though he was he was tall and must in youth have been high and proud indeed I greet you he said and maybe you

          
          25:04:08
          look for welcome but truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here Master Gandalf you've ever been a hled of Woe troubles follow you like crows and ever the oftener the worse I will not deceive you when I heard that shadowfax had come back ridless I rejoiced at the return of the horse but still more at the lack of the rider and when Arma brought the tidings that you had gone at last to your long home I did not mourn but news from AAR is seldom sooth here you come again and with you come evils worse than

          
          25:04:45
          before as might be expected why should I welcome you can Al stormcrow tell me that slowly he sat down again in his chair you speak justly lord said The Pale Man sitting upon the steps of the deas it is not yet 5 days since the bitter Tidings came that Theo dread your son was slain upon the West Marchers your right hand second Marshall of the mark in armor there is little trust few men would be left to guard your walls if you'd been allowed to rule and even now we learn from Gondor the the dark lord

          seemed that to speed you from the land the price was not too great I guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more you will seek Aid rather than render it do you bring men do you bring horses swords Spears that would call Aid that is our present need but who are these that follow at your tail three ragged wanders in Gray and you yourself the most beggar like of the four the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden son of thle said Gandalf has not the messenger from your gate reported the names of my

          25:11:28
          thoughtful was her glance as she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes very fair was her face and her long hair was like a river of gold slender and tall she was in her white robe Girt with silver but strong she seemed and Stern a steel a daughter of Kings thus Aragon for the first time in the full light of day day beheld aowin Lady of Rohan and thought her fair fair and cold like a morning of pale spring that has not yet come to Womanhood and she now was suddenly aware of him tall heir of Kings

          25:12:45
          wind had shifted to the north and already the storm that had come out of the East was proceeding rolling away Southward to the Sea suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed down the falling showers gleamed like silver and far away the river glittered like a shimmering glass it is not so dark H said Theoden no said gendal nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as some would have you think cast aside your prop from from the king's hand the Black Star fell clattering on the stones he drew himself

          Grim yet he looked at gandal and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were smoothed away and did not return When hmer had been summoned and had gone Gandalf LED Theoden to a stone seat and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair Aragorn and His companion stood nearby there is no hope to tell all that you should hear said Gandalf yet if my hope is not cheated a time will come a when I can speak more fully behold you are come into a Peril greater even that the wit of Worm tongue could weave into

          his hand he held a drawn sword and as he knelt he offered the hilt to his master how Comes This said Theoden sternly he turned towards Elma and the men looked in Wonder at him standing now proud and erect where was the old man whom they had left crouching in his chair or leaning on his stick it is my doing Lord said HMA trembling I understood that Arma was to be set free such Joy was in my heart that maybe have heard yet since he was free again and he a marshal of the Mark I brought him his sword as he B me to

          own sword GRE has it in his keeping bring him to me also now gandal you said that you had counsel to give if I would hear it what is your counsel you have yourself already taken it answered Gandalf to put your trust in aom rather than in a man of crooked mind to cast aside regret and fear to do the deed at hand every man that can ride should be sent West at once as AA counseled you we must first destroy the threat of San while we have time if we fail we fall if we succeed then we will face the next task Meanwhile your people

          
          25:20:32
          that are left the women and the children and the old should fly to the refuges that you have in the mountains were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this let them take provision but delay not nor burden themselves with treasures great or small it is their their lives that are at stake this Council seems good to me now said Theoden let all my folk get ready but you my guests truly you said Gandalf that the courtesy of my hall is lessened you have ridden through the night and the morning wears away you have had

          
          25:21:06

          25:21:44
          lead your people swiftly to the hold of danaro in the Hills nay Gandalf said the king you do not know your own skill in healing it shall not be so I myself will go to war to fall in the front of the battle if it must be thus shall I sleep better then even the defeat of Rohan will be glorious and song said Aragon the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying the lord of the Mark will ride forth aoling us but your people must not be both honor armed and shepherdess said Gandalf who shall guide

          
          25:22:23

          25:24:21
          one shall be left not even GMA GMA shall ride too go you have yet time to clean the rust from your sword Mercy Lord whined Worm tongue gring on the ground have pity on one worn out in your service send me not from your side I at least will stand by you when all others have gone don't send your faithful GMA away you have my pity said Theoden and I don't send you from my side I go myself to war with my men I bid you come with me and prove your faith worm Tong looked from face to face in his eyes was the

          
          25:24:59
          haunted look of a beast seeking some Gap in the ring of his enemies he licked his lips with a long pale tongue such a resolve might be expected from The Lord of the House of AOL old though he be he said but those who truly love him would spare his failing Years yet I see that I come too late others whom the death of my Lord would perhaps grieve less have already persuaded him if I can't undo their work hear me at least in this Lord one who knows your mind and honors your commands should be left in edus a point

          
          25:25:34
          a faithful steward let your councel agree keep all things till your return and I pray that we may see it though no wise man will deem it hopeful Amma laughed and if that plea doesn't excuse you from from war most normal Worm tongue he said what office of less honor would you accept to carry a sec of meal up into the mountains If any man could trust you with it n am you don't fully understand the mind of Master wormtongue said gandal turning his piercing glance upon Him is bold and cunning even now he

          
          25:26:10
          plays a game with Peril and wins a throw hours of my precious time he's wasted already down Snak he said in a terrible voice down on you Billy how long is it since San bought you what was the promised price when all the men were dead you were to pick your share of the treasure and take the woman you desire too long have you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps Amma grasped his sword that I knew already he muttered for that reason I would have slain him before forgetting the law of

          
          25:26:44
          the hall but there are other reasons he stepped forward but Gand Al stayed him with his hand airwin is safe now he said but you Worm tongue you've done what you could for your true Master some reward you have earned at least yet San is apt to overlook his Bargains I should advise you to go quickly and remind him lest he forget your faithful service you lie said worm Tong that word comes too of and easy from your lips said Gandalf I do not lie see there and here is a Snak with safety you can't take it with you

          
          25:27:23
          nor can you leave it behind to slay it would be just but it wasn't always as it is now once it was a man and did you service in its fashion give him a horse and let him go at once wherever he chooses by his choice you shall judge him do you hear this Worm tongue said Thon this is your choice to ride with me to war and let us see in battle whether you are true what to go now with you will but then if ever we meet again I shall not be merciful slowly Worm tongue Rose he looked at them with half closed eyes

          
          25:28:02
          last of all he scanned theoden's face and opened his mouth as if to speak then suddenly he drew himself up his hands worked his eyes glittered such malice was in them that men stepped back from him he Beed his teeth and then with a hissing breath he spat before the king's feet and darting to one side he fled down the stair after him said the Odin see that he does no harm to any but don't hurt him or hinder him give him a horse if he wishes it and if any will bear him said Elma one of the guards ran

          
          25:28:36
          down the stair another went to the well at the foot of the teris and in his Helm Drew water with it he washed clean the stones that worm Tong had defiled now my guests come said Thon come and take such refreshment as haste allows they passed back into the great house already they heard below them in the town the Heralds crying and the war horns blowing for the King was to ride forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled at the king's board satma and

          
          25:29:12
          the four guests and there also waiting upon the King was the lady Awin they ate and drank swiftly the others were silent while Theoden questioned Gandalf concerning San how far back is treachery goes who can guess said Gandalf he wasn't always evil once I don't doubt that he was the friend of Rowan and even when his heart grew colder he found you useful still but for long now he's plotted your ruin wearing the mask of friendship until he was ready in those years worm Tong t task was easy and all that you did was

          
          25:29:50
          swiftly known in Eisen guard for your land was open and strangers came and went and ever worm Tong's Whispering was in your ears poisoning your thought chilling your heart weakening your limbs While others watched and could do nothing but your will was in his keeping but when I escaped and warned you then the mask was torn for those who would see after that Worm tongue played dangerously always seeking to lay you to prevent your full strength being gathered he was crafty darling men's weariness or working on their fears as

          
          25:30:27
          sered the occasion do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on a wild goose chase northward when the immediate Peril was westward he persuaded you to forbid Arma to pursue the raiding Orcs if Arma had not defied worm Tong's voice speaking with your mouth those Orcs would have reached I guard by now bearing a great prize not indeed that prize which Salamon desires Above All Else But at the least two members of my company sharers of a secret hope of which even to you lord I can't yet speak openly

          
          25:31:05
          dare you think of what they might now be suffering or what Salamon might now have learned to our destruction I owe much to Amma said Thon faithful heart may have frow a d T say also said Gandalf that the crooked eyes Truth May wear a Ry face indeed my eyes were almost blind said theodan most of all I owe to you my guest once again you've come in time I would give you a gift here we go at your own choosing you have only to name all that is mine I reserve now only my sword whether I came in time or not is

          
          25:31:46
          yet to be seen said Gandalf but as for your gift Lord I'll choose one that will fit my need Swift and sure give me shadowx he was only let before if Lone we may call it but now I shall ride him into great Hazard setting silver against black I wouldn't risk anything that is not my own and already there is a bond of love between us you choose well said thin and I give him now gladly yet it's a great GI there is none like the shadow in him one of the mighty steeds of old is returned none shall return

          
          25:32:26
          again and to you my other guests I will offer such things as may be found in my Armory swords you don't need but there are Helms and coats of mail of cunning work gifts to my fathers out of Gondor choose from these there we go and may they serve you well now men came bearing r of war from the king's horde and they arrayed Aragon and Legolas in shining maale Helms too they chose and round Shields their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems green and red and white Gandalf took no armor and gimly needed

          
          25:33:05
          no coat of rings even if one had been found to match his stature for there was now haboc in the hordes of edoras of better make than his short corselet forged beneath the mountain in the north but he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon his round head and a small Shield he also took it bore the running horse white upon green that was the emblem of the House of AOL may it keep you well said Theoden it was made for me in thingle day while still I was a boy gimy bowed I am proud lord of the mark to Bear your device he

          
          25:33:43
          said indeed sooner would I bear a horse than be borne by one I love my feet bitter but maybe I shall come yet where I can stand and fight it may well be so said theodan the king now Rose and at once aan came forward bearing wine f f and H she said receive now this cup and drink in happy hour Health be with thee at thy going and coming they and drank from the cup and she then proferred it to the guests as as she stood before Aragorn she paused suddenly and looked upon him and her eyes were shining and he looked down upon her Fair

          
          25:34:26
          face and smiled but as he took the cup his hand met hers and he knew that she trembled at the touch hail Aragorn son of arthorn she said hail Lady of Rowan he answered but his face now was troubled and he didn't smile when they' all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors there the gods awaited him and heral stood and all the Lords and Chiefs were gathered together that remained in ER us or dwelt nearby behold I go forth and it seems like to be my last riding said theodan I have no child theodred my son is slain I name

          
          25:35:10
          Elma my sister son to be my Heir if neither of us return then choose a new Lord as you will but to someone I must now entrust my people that I leave behind to rule them in my place which of you will stay no man spoke is there none whom you would name in whom do my people trust in the house of AOL answered hmer but aama I can't spare nor stay said the king and he's the last of that house I said not aama answered hmer and he isn't the last there's Ain daughter of Elman his sister she is fearless and highe hearted all

          
          25:35:55
          love her let her be as Lord to the hingus while we gone it shall be so said Thon let the Heralds announce to the folk that the lady award will lead them then the king sat upon a seat before his doors and aw knelt before him and received from him a sword and a fair corselet farewell sister said daughter he said dark is the hour yet maybe we shall return to the golden Hall but in dhow the people may long defend themselves and if the battle go ill thither will come all who Escape speak not so she answered a year shall I

          
          25:36:36
          Endure for every day that passes until your return but as she spoke her eyes went to Aragorn who stood nearby the king shall come again he said fear not not west but east does our Doom await us the king now went down the stair with Gandalf beside him the others followed Aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate alone aan stood before the doors of the house at the stairs head the sword was set upright before her and her hands were laid upon the hilt she was clad now in male and Shone like silver in the sun gim walked with

          
          25:37:15
          legalis his ax on his shoulder well at last we set off he said men need many words before deed my ax is restless in my hands though I doubt not that these rerum are fell-handed when they come to it nonetheless this isn't the Warfare that suits me how shall I come to the battle I wish I could walk and not bump like a sack at Gandalf saddlebow a safer seat than many I guess said Legolas yet doubtless gandal would gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin or shadowfax himself an axe is no weapon for a rider and a dwarf is

          
          25:37:56
          no Horseman it is orc neck I would he not shave the scalps of men said gimy patting the half of his ax at the gate they found a great host of men old and young all ready in the saddle more than a thousand were their mustard their Spears were like a springing wood loudly and joyously they shouted as theodan came forth some held in read the king's horse Snowman and others held the horses of Aragorn and Legolas gimly stood ill at ease frowning M came up to him leading his horse hail gimy glowing son

          
          25:38:34
          he cried I haven't had time to learn gentle speech under your Rod as you promised but shall we not put aside our quarrel at least I will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood I will forget my wroth for a while Almer son of aond said gimy but if ever you chance to see the lady gadriel with your eyes then you shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies or our friendship will end so be it said AAR but until that time pardon me and in token of Pardon ride with me I beg Gandalf will be at the head with a lord of the mark but

          
          25:39:15
          faroot my horse will spare us both if you will I thank you indeed said gimy greatly pleased I'd gladly go with you if legus my comrade May ride beside us it shall be so said a legus upon my left and Aron upon my right and none will dare to stand before us where's shadowx said Gandalf running wild over the grass they answered he'll let no man handle him there he goes away down by the Ford like a shadow Among The Willows Gandalf whistled and called aloud the horse's name and far away he tossed his head and n and turning sped

          
          25:39:58
          towards the host like an arrow were the breath of the West Wind to take a body visible even so would it appear said Elma as the great horse ran up until he stood before the wizard The Gift seems already to be given said theodan but Howen all here and now I name my guest Gandalf grahame wisest of counselors most welcome of wandrers a lord of the mark a Chieftain of the air lingers while our kin shall last and I give to him shadowfax Prince of horses I thank you Theoden King said Gandalf then suddenly he threw back his gray cloak

          
          25:40:40
          and cast aside his hat and leapt to horseback he wore no Helm nor mail his snowy hair flew free in the wind his white robe Shone dazzling in the sun behold the white Rider said Aragon and all took up the words ah King on the white Rider they shouted forth a lingers the trumpet sounded the horses reared and N spear clashed on Shield then the king raised his hand and with a rush like the sudden onset of a great wind the last host of Rowan rode thundering into the West over the plain a and saw the glitter of

          
          25:41:20
          their Spears as she stood still alone before the doors of the Silent House chapter 7 Helms Deep the sun was already westering as they rode from edoras and the light of it was in their eyes turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to a golden hail is there was a beaten way northwestward along the foothills of the White Mountains and this they followed up and down in a Green Country Crossing small Swift streams by many Fords far ahead and to their right the Misty Mountains loomed ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by

          
          25:42:09
          the sun went slowly down before them evening came behind the host rode on need drove them fearing to come too late they rode with all the speed they could pausing seldom Swift did enduring with the steeds of Rohan but there were many leagues to go 40 leagues and more it was as a bird flies from adoras to the Fords of the E where they hoped to find the King's Men that held back the hosts of Saron night closed about them at last they halted to make their Camp they had ridden for some five hours and were far

          
          25:42:49
          out upon the western plain yet more than half their Journey lay still before them in a great circle Under The Starry Sky and the waxing moon they now made their bivak they lit no fars for they were uncertain of events but they set a ring of mounted guards about them and Scouts rode out far ahead passing like shadows in the folds of the land the slow night passed without Tidings or alarm at dawn the horn sounded and within an hour they took the road again there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was in the air it was

          
          25:43:30
          hot for the season of the year the Rising Sun was hazy and behind it following it slowly up the sky there was a growing Darkness as of a great storm moving out of the East and Away in the Northwest there seemed to be another Darkness brooding about the field of the Misty Mountains a shadow that crept slowly from the Wizard's Veil Gandalf dropped back to where legus Rod beside Amma you have the Keen eyes of your fair Kindred Legas he said and they can tell a sparrow from a Fincher leag off tell me can you see anything away Yonder

          
          25:44:07
          toward Eisen guard many miles lie between said Legolas gazing thither and shading his eyes with his long hand I can see a Darkness there are shapes moving in it great shapes far away upon the bank of the river but what they are I can't tell it's not mist or Cloud that defeats my eyes there is a veiling shadow that some power lays upon the land and it marches slowly Downstream it's as if the Twilight under endless trees were flowing downwards from the hills and behind us comes a very storm of Mordor said Gandalf it will be a

          
          25:44:49
          black night as the second day of their riding Drew on the heaviness in the air increased in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them a somber canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light the sun went down blood red in a smoking Haze the spears of the Riders were tipped with fire as the last shafts of light kindled the Steep faces of the peaks of three now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the White Mountains three Jagged horns staring at the sunset in the last red glow men in the Vanguard

          
          25:45:28
          saw a black Speck a Horseman riding back towards them they halted awaiting him he came a weary man with dented Helm and cloven Shield slowly he climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping at length he spoke is Amma here he asked you come at last but too late and with too little strength things have gone evily since theod fell we were driven back yesterday over the ice and with great loss many perished at the Crossing then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp all ice and card must be

          
          25:46:12
          emptied and San has armed the wild Hillman and heard folk of dunland Beyond on the rivers and these also he loosed upon us we were overmastered the shield wall was broken Eren brand of westfold has drawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in Helms Deep the rest are scattered where is Elma tell him there's no hope ahead he should return to edus before the Wolves of I guard come there Theoden had sat silent hidden from the man's sight behind his guards now he urged his horse forward come stand

          
          25:46:52
          before me kol he said I am here the last host of the air lingers has ritten forth it will not return without battle the man's face lightened with joy and wonder he drew himself up then he knelt offering his notched sword to the king command me my Lord he cried and pardon me I thought you thought I remained in Meadow seld bent like an old tree under winter snow so it was when you rode to war but a West Wind has Shake in the boughs said Theoden give this man a fresh horse let us ride to the help of

          
          25:47:31
          aen brand while Theoden was speaking gandal rode a short way ahead and he sat there alone gazing North to Eisen guard and West to the Setting Sun now he came back ride theen he said ride to Helms Deep go not to the Fords of Eisen and don't T in the plane I must leave you for a while shadowax must bear me now on a swift errand turning to Aragorn and Amma and the men of the king's household he cried keep well the lord of the mark till I return await me at Helm's gate farewell he spoke a word to shadex and

          
          25:48:13
          like an arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away even as they looked he was gone a flash of silver in the sunset a wind over the grass a shadow that fled and passed from sight snowman snorted and reared eager to follow but only a swift bird on the wing could have overtaken him what does that mean said one of the guards to hmer that Gandalf greim has need of haste answered hmer ever he goes and comes unlooked for Worm tongue would he hear would find it hard to explain said the other true enough

          
          25:48:50
          said harmer but for myself I'll wait until I see Gandalf again maybe you'll wait long said the other the host turned away now from the roads of the Fords of ion and bent their course Southward night fell and still they rode on the Hills Drew near but the tall peaks of three were already dim against the darkening Sky still still some miles away on the far side of the westfold veil lay a green Kum a great Bay in the mountains out of which a Gorge opened in the Hills men of that land called it Helm's Deep

          
          25:49:30
          after a hero of old Wars who had made his Refuge there ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north under the shadow of the three Hein till the crow haunted Cliffs Rose like Mighty Towers on either side shutting out the light at Helm's gate before the mouth of the deep there was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern Cliff there upon its spur stood High walls of ancient stone and within them was a lofty Tower men said that in the far off days of the glory of Gondor the sea Kings had built

          
          25:50:07
          here this fastness with the hands of giants the hornberg it was called for a trumpet sounded upon the tower echoed in the Deep behind as if armies long forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills a wall two the men of old had made from the hornberg to the southern Cliff barring the entrance to the gorge beneath it by a wide culet the deeping stream passed out about the feet of the horn rocket wound and flowed then in a galley through the midst of a wide green Gore sloping gently down from Helm's

          
          25:50:43
          gate to Helm's Dyke then it fell into the deep Inc and out into the westfold veil there in the hornberg of Helms gate Eren brand master of westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt as the days darkened with threats of War being wise he had repaired the wall and made the fastness strong the Riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the Kum when cries and Horn blasts were heard from their Scouts that went in front out of the darkness arrows whistled swiftly a scout rode back and

          
          25:51:18

          25:52:33
          known how great is the host that comes from the north it's very great said the Scout he that flies counts every fo and twice yet I've spoken to stouthearted men and I don't doubt that the main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here then let us be swift said Elma let us drive through such foes as are already between us and the fastness there are caves in Helms Deep where hundreds May lie hid and secret ways lead then up onto the hills trust not to secret ways said the

          25:53:42
          to the leaders of our enemies San or whatever Captain he sent forth the rumor of War grew behind them now they could hear borne over the dark the sound of harsh singing they' climbed far up into the deeping comb when they looked back then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon the black Fields behind scattered like red flowers or winding up from the lowlands in Long flickering lines here and there a larger blaze leapt up it's a great host and follows us hard said Aragon they bring Far said Theoden

          
          25:54:21
          and they're burning as they come Rick cot and tree this was a rich Veil and had many homesteads Al last for my folk would that day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm out of the mountains said Aragorn it Grieves me to fly before them we needn't fly much further said Elma not far ahead now lies Helms DK an ancient trench and ramper scored across the Kum two furlongs below Helm's gate there we can turn and give battle nay we're too few to defend the Dyke said Theon it's a mile long or more

          
          25:54:59
          and the breach in it is wide at the breach our rear guard must stand if we're pressed said Arma there was neither star nor moon when the riders came to the breach in the Dyke where the stream from above passed out and the road beside it ran down from the the hornberg the rampant loomed suddenly before them a high Shadow Beyond a dark pit as they rode up a sentinel challenged them the lord of the mark rides to Helm's gate amama answered I amama son of aand speak this is good tidings Beyond hope said the Sentinel hasten the enemy is on

          
          25:55:41
          your heels the host passed to the beach and halted on the sloping sword above they now learned to their joy that a and brown had left many men to hold Helm's gate and more had since escaped thither maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot said gambling an old man the leader of those that watched the Dyke but most of them have seen too many Winters as I have or too few as my son son here what news of aren brand word came yesterday that he was retreating thither with all that's left to the best

          
          25:56:17
          Riders of westfold but he's not come I fear that he won't come now said Elma our Scouts have gained no news of him and the enemy fills all the valley behind us I would that he'd escaped said Theoden he was a mighty man in him lived Again The Valor of Helm the hammerand but we can't await him here we must draw all our forces now behind the walls are you well stored we bring little provision for we rode forth to open battle not to a Siege behind us in the caves of the deep are three parts of the folk of westfold

          
          25:56:55
          old and young children and women said gambling but great store of food and many beasts in their fod have also been gathered there that is well said herma they are burning order spoiling all that is left in the veil if they come to bargain for our Goods at elmsgate they'll pay a high price said gambling the king and his Riders passed on before the causeway that crossed the stream they dismounted in a long file they LED their horses up the ramp and passed within the gates of the hornberg there they were welcomed again

          
          25:57:32
          with joy and renewed hope for now there were men enough to man both the Berg and the barrier wall quickly AA set his men in Readiness the king and the men of his household were in the hornberg and there all also were many of the westfold men but on the deeping wall and its Tower and behind it aama arrayed most of the strength that he had for here the defense seemed more doubtful if the assault were determined and in great force the horses were LED far up the deep under such guard as could be spared the deeping wall was 20 ft high

          
          25:58:09
          and so thick that four men could walk a breast along the top sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall man could look look here and there were cliffs in the stone through which men could shoot the Battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a door in the outer Court of the hornberg three flights of steps LED also up onto the wall from the deep behind but in front it was smooth and the great stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joints and at the top they hung over

          
          25:58:41
          like a sea delved cliff gimly stood leaning against the breast work upon the wall legala sat above on the parapet fingering his bow and peering out into the Gloom this is more to my liking said the dwarf stamping on the stones ever my heart Rises as we draw near the mountains there's good rock here this country has tough bones I felt them in my feet as we came up from the Dyke give me a year and a 100 of my kin and I'd make this is a place that armies would break upon like water I don't doubt it said Legolas but

          
          25:59:23
          you're a dwarf and dwarves are strange folk I don't like this place and I should like it no more by the light of day but you comfort me gimy and I'm glad to have you standing nigh with your Stout legs on your hard a I wish there were more of your kin among us but even more would I give for a 100 good archers of merkwood we shall need them the roam have good Bowman after their fashion but there are too few here too few it's dark for archery said gimy indeed it's time for sleep sleep I feel the need of it as never I thought any

          
          26:00:00
          dwarf could riding is tiring work yet my ax is restless in my hand give me a row of orc necks and room to swing and all weariness will fall from me a slow time passed far down in the valley scattered fire still burned the hosts of Eis andard were advancing in silence now their torches could be seen winding up the Kum in many lines suddenly from the Dyke yells and screams and the fierce battlecries of men broke out flaming BRS appeared above the brink and clustered thickly at the breach then they scattered and vanished

          
          26:00:40
          men came Galloping back over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the hornberg the rear guard of the West folders had been driven in the enemy is at hand they said we Loos every arrow that we had and filled the Dy with Orcs but it won't halt them long already they're scaling the bank at many points thick as marching ants but we've taught them not to carry torches it was now past midnight the sky was utterly dark and the Stillness of the heavy Air foreboded Storm suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding

          
          26:01:15
          Flash branched lightning smoted down upon the Eastward Hills for a staring moment the Watchers on the wall Saw the space between them and the Dyke lit with white light it was boiling and crawling with black shapes some Squat and Broad some tall and Grim with high Helms and Sable Shields hundreds and hundreds more were pouring over the Dyke and through the breach the dark tide flowed up to the walls from Cliff to Cliff Thunder rolled in the valley rain came lashing down arrows thick as the rain came

          
          26:01:50
          whistling over the battlements and fell clinking and glancing on the Stones Some found a mark the assault on Helm's Deep had begun but no sound or challenge Was Heard within no answering arrows came the assailing hosts halted foiled by the silent Menace of rock and wall ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness then the orc screamed waving spear and sword and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed upon the battlements and the men of the mark amazed looked out as it seemed to them upon a great field of

          
          26:02:26
          dark corn tossed by a tempest of war and every ear glinted with barbed light Brazen trumpets sounded the enemy surged forward some against the deeping wall others towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornberg gates there the hugest stalks were mastered and the wild men of the dunland Fells a moment they hesitated and then on they came the lightning flashed and blazed upon every Helm and shield the ghastly hand of Eisen guard was seen they reached the summit of the rock they drove towards

          
          26:03:03
          the gates then at last an answer came a storm of arrows met them and a hail of stones they wavered broke and fled back and then charged again broke and charged again and each time like the incoming sea they halted at a higher Point again trumpets rang and a press of roaring men leapt forth they held their great Shields above them like a roof while in their midst they bore two trunks of Mighty trees behind them orc archers crowded sending a hail of darts Against The Bowman on the walls they gained the gates the trees swung by

          
          26:03:44
          strong arms smot the Timbers with rending boom If any man fell crushed by a stone hurtling from above two others sprang to take his place again and again the great Ram swung and crashed Amar and Aragon stood together on the deeping wall they heard the Roar of voices and the thudding of the Rams and then in a sudden flash of light they beheld the pedal of the gates come said Aragorn this is the hour when we draw swords together running like fire they sped along the wall and up the steps and passed into the outer

          
          26:04:20
          Court upon the rock as they ran they gathered a handful of stout swordsman there was a small Poston door that opened in an angle of the Berg wall on the west where the cliff stretched out to meet it on that side a narrow path ran around towards the Great Gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock together Elma and Aragon sprang through the door their men close behind the swords flashed from the sheath as one go winner cried Amma go winner for the mark anduril cried Aragon andur for the

          
          26:04:57
          dine charging from the side they hurled themselves upon the wild men anduril Rose and fell gleaming with white fire a shout went up from wall and Tower anduril anduril goes to war the blade that was broken shines again dismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight but the wall of their Shields was broken as by a lightning stroke and they were Swept Away heun down or cast Over The Rock into the Stony stream below the orc archers shot wildly and then fled for a moment Arma and Aragon halted before the gates the

          
          26:05:38
          Thunder was rumbling in the distance now the lightning flickered still far off among the mountains in the south a keen wind was blowing from the north again the clouds were torn and drifting and stars peeped out and above the hills of the cide the westering Moon Road glimmering yellow in the storm wreck we didn't come too soon said aror looking at the gates their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and vent many of their Timbers were cracked yet we can't stay here beyond the walls to defend them said armmer

          
          26:06:14
          look he pointed to the causeway already a great press Of Orcs And Men were gathered again Beyond The Stream arrows wind and skipped on the stones about them come we must get back and see what we can do to pile Stone and beam across the gates within come now they turned and ran at that moment some two dozen Orcs that had lay motionless among the slain leapt to their feet and came silently and swiftly behind two flung themselves to the ground at amma's heels tripped him and in a moment they were on top of him but a small dark

          
          26:06:53
          figure that none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a horse shout bar kazad kazad IU an axe swung and swept back two Orcs fell headless the rest fled Aus struggled to his feet even as Aragorn ran back to his Aid the post turn was closed again the iron door was barred and piled inside with stones when all were safe within Amma turned I thank you gimly son of gloin he said I didn't know that you were with us in the sorty but of the unbidden guest proves the best company how came you here I

          
          26:07:34
          followed you to shake off sleep said gimy but I looked on the Hillman and they seemed overlarge for me so I set beside a stone to see your sword play I sh find it easy to repay you said Amma there may be many a chance if the night is over laughed the dwarf but I'm content till now I've heed not but wood since I left Moria two said gimy patting his ax he turned to his place on the wall two said Legolas I've done better though now I must grope for spent arrows all mine are gone yet I make my tail 20 at the least

          
          26:08:16
          but that's only a few leaves in a forest the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly but the light brought little hope to the Riders of the mark the enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished and still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach the sorty upon the rock gained only a brief respit The Assault on the gates was redoubled against the deeping wall the hosts of Eis and guard roared like a sea Orcs And hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end ropes

          
          26:08:51
          with grappling hooks were hurled over the parit faster than men could cut them or fling them back hundreds of long ladders were lifted up many were cast down in ruin but many more replac them and Orcs sprang up them like apes in the dark Forest of the South before the Wall's foot the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm ever higher Rose the Hideous mounds and still the enemy came on the men of Rohan grew weary all their arrows were spent and every shaft was shot their swords were noted and their

          
          26:09:24
          shields were Riven three times Aragon and Elma red them and three times anduril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall then a clamor arose in the Deep behind Orcs had tript like rats through the culet through which the stream flowed out there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs until the the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men of the defense had rushed to the walls top then they sprang out already some had passed into the jaws of the deep and were among the horses fighting

          
          26:09:58
          with the guards down from the wall leapt gimly with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs khazard khazard he soon had work enough I O he shouted the Orcs are behind the wall o o come legus there are enough for us both Kaz I menu gambling the old looked down from the hornberg hearing the great voice of the dwarf above all the tumult the Orcs are in the Deep he cried Helm Helm forth helming us he shouted as he leapt down the stair from The Rock With Many Men of westfold at his back their onset was fierce and sudden and

          
          26:10:42
          the Orcs gave way before them air long they were hemmed in in the Narrows of the gorge and all were slain or driven shrieking into the chasm of the deep to fall before the Guardians of the hidden caves 21 cried gimy he hued a two-handed stroke and laid the last orc before his feet now my count passes Master legus again we must stop this Rat Hole said gambling dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone lend us your Aid Master we don't shape stone with battle axes nor with our fingernails said gimy but

          
          26:11:20
          I'll help as I may they gathered such small Boulders and broken Stones as they could find to hand and under gim's Direction the westfold men blocked up the inner end of the culet until only a narrow Outlet remained then the deeping stream swollen by the rain churned and Fred in its choked path and spread slowly in cold pools from Cliff to Cliff it will be drier above said gimy come gambling let's see how things go on the wall he climbed up and found legalis beside Aragon and Amma the elf was wetting his long knife there was for a

          
          26:12:01
          while a lull in the assault since the attempt to break in through the culet had been foiled 21 said gimy good said deas but my count is now two dozen it's been knif work up here Aur and Aragon lent wearily on their swords away on the left the crash and clamor of the battle on the Rock Rose loud again but the hornberg still held fast like an island in the sea its Gates lay in ruin but over the barricade of beams and Stones within no enemy as yet had passed Aragorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon now sloping behind the

          
          26:12:42
          Western Hills that enclos the valley this is a night as long as years he said how long will the day T Dawn is not far off said gambling who had now climbed up beside him but Dawn won't help us I fear yet Dawn is ever the hope of men said Aragorn but these creatures of Eisen guard these half Orcs And Goblin men that the foul craft of Sous bread they'll not Quail at the sun said gambling and neither will the wild the men of the hills don't you hear their voices I hear them said Amma but they're only the scream of birds and the Bing of

          
          26:13:24
          beasts to my ears yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue said gambling I know that tongue it's an ancient speech of men and once was spoken in many Western valleys of the mark hark they hate us and they're glad for our Doom seems certain to them the king the king the they cry we'll take their King death to the forgo death to the straw heads death to the robbers of the north such names they have for us not in half a thousand years have they forgotten their grievance that the Lords of Gondor gave the mark to a the young

          
          26:14:01
          and made alliance with him that old hatred seron is inflamed they're fierce folk when aroused they'll not give way now for dusk gor until Theon is taken or they themselves are slain nonetheless they will bring hope to me said Aragon is it not said that no foe has ever taken the hornberg if men defended it so the minstral say said a then let us defend it and hope said Aragon even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke the Waters of the deeping stream poured out hissing

          
          26:14:42
          and foaming they were choked no longer a gaping hole was blasted in the wall a host of dark shapes poured in devilry of Salamon cried Aragon they've crept in the calvet again while we talked and they've lit the fire of orun beneath our feet hendil alil he shouted as he leapt down into the breach but even as he did so a 100 ladders were raised against the battlements over the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand that fence was Swept Away some of the Riders were driven back

          
          26:15:19
          further and further into the deep falling and fighting as they gave way step by step towards the caves others cut their way back towards the Citadel a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to the Rock and the rear gate of the hornberg near the bottom stood Aragon in his hand still anduril gleamed and the terror of the sword for a while held back the enemy as one by one all could gain the stair passed up towards the gate behind on the upper steps knelt Legolas his bow was bent but one gleaned Arrow was all that he had

          
          26:15:55
          left and he peered out now ready to shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair all who can have now got safe within Aragon he called come back Aragon turned and sped up the stair but as he ran he stumbled in his weariness at once his enemies leapt forward up came the Orcs yelling where their long arms stretched out to seize him the foremost fell with legolas's last arrow in his throat but the rest sprang over him then a great Boulder cast from the outer wall above crashed down upon the stair and

          
          26:16:31
          hurled them back into the deep Aragorn gained the door and swiftly it clanged two behind him things go ill my friends he said wiping the sweat from his brow with his arm ill enough s us but not yet hopeless while we have you with us where's gim I don't know said Aragorn I last saw him fighting on the ground behind the wall but the enemy swept us apart alas that's Evil news said Legolas he's Stout and strong said Aragon let's hope that he'll Escape back to the caves there he'd be safe for a while safer

          
          26:17:09
          than we such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf that must Be My Hope said legus but I wish that it'd come this way I desired to tell master gimy that my taale is now 39 if he wins back to the caves he'll pass your count again laughed Aragon never did I see an ax so wielded I must go and seek some arrows said Legas would that this night would end and I could have better light for shooting Aragon now passed into the Citadel there to his dismay he learned that AA hadn't reached the hornberg Nay he didn't come to the Rock

          
          26:17:50
          said one of the westfold men I last saw him Gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the deep gambling was with him and the dwarf but I couldn't come to them Aragon stroe on through the inner court and mounted to a high chamber in the tower there stood the king Dark against a narrow window looking out upon the veil what is the news go he said the deeping wall is taken Lord and all the defense swept away but many have escaped hither to the rock is Amma here no Lord but many of your men retreated into the

          
          26:18:28
          deep and some say that Amma was amongst them in the natows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves what hope they may have then I don't know more than we good provision it said and the air is wholesome there cause of the outlets through fishes in the Rock far above none can force an entrance against determined men they may hold out long but the Orcs have brought a devilry from oron said Aragorn they have a blasting fire and with it they took the wall if they can't come in the caves

          
          26:19:05
          they may seal up those that are inside but now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defense I fret in this prison said Theoden if I could have set a spear in rest riding before my men upon the field maybe I could have felt again the joy of battle and so ended but I serve little purpose here here at least you're guarded in the strongest fastness of the Mark said Aragon more hope we have to defend you in the hornberg than in edus or even at D herrow in the mountains it's said that the hornberg

          
          26:19:40
          has never fallen to assault said the hon but now my heart is d the world changes and all that once was strong now proves Unsure how shall any Tower withstand such numbers in such Reckless hate had I known that the strength of Eisen guard was grown so great maybe I shouldn't so rashly have ridden forth to meet it for all the Arts of Gandalf his Council seems not now so good as it did Under The Morning Sun don't charge the Council of gandal until all is over lord said Aragorn the end will not belong said the king but I

          
          26:20:17
          won't end here taken like an old badger in a trap Snowman and H of fell and the horses of my guard are in the inner Court when Dawn comes I'll bid my men sound Helm's horn and I'll ride forth will you ride with me then son of arthorn maybe we shall cleave a road or make such an end as will be worth a song If any be left to sing of us Hereafter I'll ride with you said Aragon taking his leave he returned to the walls and passed round all their circuit andhe heartening the men and lending Aid wherever the assault was hot legalis

          
          26:20:58
          went with him blasts of fire leapt Up From Below shaking the stones grappling hooks were H and ladders raised again and again the Orcs gained the summit of the outer wall and again the Defenders cast them down at last Aragon stood above the great Gates heedless of the darts of the enemy as he looked forth he saw the Eastern Sky grow pale then he raised his empty hand Palm outward in token of parley the Orcs yelled and Jered come down come down they cried if you wish to speak to us come down bring out your

          
          26:21:38
          king we're the fighting urokai we'll fetch him from his hole if he doesn't come bring out your Stout K King The King stays or comes at his own will said Aragorn then what are you doing here they answered why do you look out do you wish to see the greatness of our army we are the fighting urai I looked out to see the dawn said Aragorn what of the Dawn they Jared we are the urai we don't stop the fight for night or day for fair weather or off a storm we come to kill my son or moon what of the Dawn none knows what the new

          
          26:22:21
          day shall bring him said Aragon get you gone ER turn to your evil get down or we'll shoot you from the wall they cried this is no party you have nothing to say I have still this to say answered Aragon no enemy has yet taken the hornberg depart or not one of you will be spared not one will be left alive to take back Tidings to the north you don't know your peril so great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragon as he stood there alone above the ruined Gates before the host of his enemies that many of the

          
          26:22:59
          wild men paused and looked back over their shoulders to the valley and some looked up doubtfully at the sky but the Orcs laughed with loud voices and a hail of darts and arows whistled over the wall as Aragorn leaped down there was a Roar and a blast of fire the archway of the gate above which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in Smoke and dust the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt Aragorn ran to the King's Tower but even as the gate fell and the Orcs about it yelled preparing to charge a murmur

          
          26:23:35
          arose behind them like a wind in the distance and it grew to a clamor of many voices crying strange news in the dawn the Orcs upon the rock he hearing the rumor of dismay wavered and looked back and then sudden and terrible from the tower above the sound of the Great Horn of Helm rang out all that heard that sound trembled many of the Orcs cast themselves on their faces and covered their ears with their claws back from the deep The Echoes came blast upon blast as if on every cliff and Hill a mighty Herald

          
          26:24:11

          night departed forth a all iners with a cry and a great noise they charged down from the gates they roed over the caway they swept and they drove through the hosts of ice and guard as a wind among grass behind them from the deep came the stern cries of men issuing from the caves driving forth the enemy outpoured all the men that were left upon the rock and ever the sound of blowing horns echoed in the hills on they Road the king and his companions captains and champions fell or fled before them neither orc nor

          
          26:25:26
          man withstood them their backs were to the swords and Spears of the Riders and their faces to the valley they cried and wailed for fear and great Wonder had come upon them with the rising of the day so King theod and rode from Helm's gate and clo his path to the great Dyke there the company halted light grew bright about them shafts of the sun flared above the Eastern Hills and glimmered on their Spears but they sat silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping Kum the land had changed where before

          
          26:26:00
          the green Dale had Lin its grassy slopes lepping the ever mounting Hills there now a forest loomed great trees bare and Silent stood rank on rank with tangled bow and Hoy head their twisted root were buried in the long green grass Darkness was under them between the Dyke and the eaves of the nameless wood only two open furlongs lay there now cowed the proud hosts of Saron in Terror of the king and in Terror of the trees they streamed down from Helm's gate until all above the Dyke was empty of them just below it

          
          26:26:37
          they were packed like swarming flies vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of the Kum seeking to escape upon the East too sheer and Stony was the valley side upon the left from the West their final Doom approached there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider clad in white shining in the Rising Sun over the low Hills the horns were sounding behind him hastening down the long slopes were a thousand men on foot their swords were in their hands amid them strowed a man tall and strong his

          
          26:27:10

          26:27:51
          hills leaped Eren brand Lord of westfold down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains the white rer was upon them and the terror of his coming filled the enemy with Madness the wild men fell on their faces before him the Orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees and from that shadow none ever came again chapter 8 the road to Eisen God so it was that in the light of a

          
          26:28:35
          fair morning King Theoden and Gandalf the White Rider met again upon the grass beside the deeping stream there was also Aragon son of arthor and Legolas the elf and aen brand of westfold and the Lords of the golden house about them were gathered the rohim the riters of the mark Wonder overcame their joy and victory and their eyes were turned towards the wood suddenly there was a great shout and down from the Dyke came those who had been driven back into the deep there came gambling the old and ARA son of aand and beside

          
          26:29:13
          them walked giml the dwarf he had no Helm and about his head was a linen band stained with blood but his voice was loud and strong 42 Master legus he cried alas my ex is notched the 42nd had an iron collar on his neck how is it with you you've passed my score by one answered legus but I don't Grudge at the game so glad I might to see you on your legs welcome a sister s said theodon now that I see you safe I'm glad indeed hail Lord of The Mark said Irma The Dark Night has passed and day has come again

          
          26:29:55
          but the day has brought strange Tidings he turned and gazed in Wonder first at the wood and then at gandal once more you come in the hour of need unlooked for he said unlooked for said Gandalf I said that I'd return and meet you here but you didn't name the r nor for tell the manner of your coming strange help you bring you are Mighty and Wizardry gned out the white that may be but if so I've not shown it yet I've but given Good Counsel in Peril and made use of the speed of Shadow your own Valor has

          
          26:30:31
          done more and the Stout legs of the westfold men marching through the night then they all gazed at Gandalf with still greater wonder some glanced Darkly at the wood and passed their hands over their brows as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his Gandalf laughed long and merrily the trees he said nay I see the wood as plainly as do you but that's no need of mine it's a thing beyond the counsil of the wise better than my design and better even than my hope the event is proved then if not yours who is the

          
          26:31:09
          Wizardry said theodan not sans's that's plain is there some mightier Sage of whom we have yet to learn it's not Wizardry but a power far older said Gandalf a power that walked the earth a elf sang or Hammer rang a iron was found or tree was Hee when young was Mountain under the moon air ring was made or Ro was woe it walked the forests long ago and what may be the answer to your riddle said theodan if you would learn that you should come with me to Eisen guard answered Gandalf to eard they cried yes said Gandalf I shall return to

          
          26:31:53
          Eisen God and those who will may come with me there we may see strange things but there are not men enough in the mark not if they were all gathered together and healed of wounds and weariness to assault the stronghold of seron said theen nevertheless to eyes and God I go said Gandalf I sh stay there long my way lies now Eastward look for me and edus he the waning of the Moon nay said Theon in the dark hour before Dawn I doubted but we won't part now I'll come with you if that's your Council I wish to speak with seron as

          
          26:32:33
          soon as may be now said Gandalf and since he's done you great injury it would be fitting if you were there but how soon and how swiftly will you ride my men are weary with battle said the king and I'm weary also for I've ridden far and slept little alas my old age is not feigned nor due only to the whisperings of wormtongue it's an ill that no leech can wholly cure not even Gandalf then let all who are to ride with me rest now said Gandalf we'll Journey under the shadow of evening it's as well for it's my counsel that all our

          
          26:33:13
          coming and going should be as secret as maybe henceforth but don't command many men to go with you theodan we go to a Pary not to a fight the king then chose men that were un hurt and had Swift horses and he sent them forth with Tidings of the victory into every veil of the mark and they bore his summons also bidding all men young and old to come in haste to Eder us there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms on the second day under the full moon to ride with him

          
          26:33:47
          to Eisen guard the king chose amama and 20 men of his household with Gandalf would go Aragon and Legolas and gimy in spite of his hurt the dwarf wouldn't stay behind it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it he said it would take more than such an orc scratch to keep me back I'll tend it while you rest said Aragon the king now returned to the hornberg and slept such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for many years and the remainder of his chosen company rested also but the others all that were

          
          26:34:26
          not hurt or wounded began a great labor for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field or in the Deep no Orcs remained alive their bodies were uncounted but a great many of the hillmen had given themselves up and they were afraid and cried for Mercy the men of the mark took their weapons from them and set them to work help now to repair the evil in which you have joined said erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the Fords of I and in arms nor to march with the enemies of

          
          26:35:02
          men and then you shall Go free back to your land for you've been deluded by Salamon many of you have got death as the reward of your trust in him but had you conquered little better would your wages have been the men of dunland were amazed for Saron had told them that the men of Rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive in the midst of the field before the hornberg two Mounds were raised and beneath them were laid all the Riders of the mark who fell in the defense those of the East Dales upon one side and

          
          26:35:39
          those of westfold upon the other in a grave alone under the shadow shadow of the hornberg lay hmer captain of the King's Guard he fell before the gate the Orcs were piled in great heaps away from the Mounds of men not far from the eaves of the forest and the people were troubled in their minds for the heaps of Karin were too great for burial or for burning they had little wood for firing and none would have dared to take an ax to the strange trees even if Gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark nor bow at their great

          
          26:36:15
          Peril let the Orcs lie said Gandalf the morning may bring new counsel in the afternoon the king's company prepared to depart the work of Bal was then but beginning and theodan mourned for the loss of hmer his captain and cast the first Earth upon his grave great injury indeed has Salomon done to me and all this land he said and I'll remember it when we meet the sun was already Drawing Near The Hills upon the west of the Kum when at last Theoden and Gandalf and their companions rode down from the Dyke

          
          26:36:54
          behind them were gathered a great host both of the Riders and of the people of westfold old and young women and children who had come out from the caves a song of Victory they sang with clear voices and then they fell silent wondering what would chance for their eyes were on the trees and they feared them the riders came to the wood and they halted horse and man they were unwilling to pass in the trees were gray and menacing and a shadow or a Mist was about them the ends of their long sweeping boughs hung

          
          26:37:29
          down like searching fingers their Roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of strange monsters and dark Caverns opened beneath them but gandal went forward leading the company and where the road from the hornberg Met the trees they saw now an opening like an arched gate under Mighty boughs and through it Gandalf ped and they followed him then to their amazement they found that the road ran on and the deeping stream beside it and the sky was open above and full of golden light but on either side

          
          26:38:01
          the great aisles of the wood were already repped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shadows and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs and far cries and a rumor of word voices murmuring angrily no orc or other living creature could be seen legus and gimy were now riding together upon one horse and they kept close beside Gandalf for gimy was afraid of the wood it's hot in here said legalist to Gandalf I feel a great wroth about me do you not feel the air throbbing your ears yes said Gandalf what has become of the

          
          26:38:42
          miserable Orcs said Nas that I think no one will ever know said Gandalf they rode in silence for a while but legalis was ever glancing from side to side and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the wood if gimy had allowed it these are the strangest trees that ever I saw he said and I've seen many an oak grow from Acorn to ruinous age I wish that there were Leisure now to walk among them they have voices and in time I might come to understand their thought no no said gimy let us leave

          
          26:39:23
          them I guess their thoughts already hatred of all that goes on two legs and their speeches of crushing and strangling not of all that go on two legs said Legolas there I think you're wrong it is Orcs that they hate for they don't belong here and know little of elves and Men far away are The Valleys where they sprang from the deep Dales of fangor gim that is whence they come I guess then that is the most perilous wood in Middle Earth said gimy I should be grateful for the part that they've played but I don't

          
          26:40:01
          love them you may think them wonderful but I've seen a greater Wonder in this land more beautiful than any Grove or Glade that ever grew my heart is still full of it Str strange are the ways of men Legas here they have one of the marvels of the northern world and what do they say of it caves they say caves holes to fly in time of War to store F in my good Legas do you know that the caverns of Helms Deep are vast and beautiful there would be an endless pilgrimage of dwarves merely to gaze at them if such a thing were known to be I

          
          26:40:41
          indeed they would pay pure gold for a brief glance and I would give gold to be excused said Legolas and double to be let out if I strayed in you've not seen so I forgive your Gest said gimy but you speak like a fool do you think those Hills are fair where your king dwells under the hill in merkwood and dwarves helped in their making long ago they but HS compared with the caverns I've seen here immeasurable Halls filled with Everlasting music of water that Tinkles into pools as Fair as kadaram in the

          banners Pinnacles of suspended palaces still Lakes miror them a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cities such as the mind of Duran could scarce have imagined in his sleep stretch on through Avenues and pillared courts on into the dark recesses where no light can come and plink a silver Drop Falls and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers Bend and waver like weeds and Corals in a grotto of the sea then evening comes they fade and twinkle out the tortures pass all into another

          26:43:19
          account maybe the men of this land are wise to say little one family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel might Mar more than they made no you don't understand said gimy no dwarf could be unmoved by such loveliness none of doin's race would mine those caves for stones or ore not if diamonds and gold could be got there there you cut down Groves of blossoming trees in the springtime for firewood we would tend these Glades of flowering Stone not quar them with cautious skill tap by tap a small chip of rock and no

          
          26:43:58
          more perhaps in a whole anxious day so we could work and as the years went by we should open up new ways and display far chambers that are still dark glimpsed only as a void Beyond fishes in the rock and lights lolus we should make lights such lamps as once sha in kard Doom and when we wished we would drive away the night that has lay there since the hills were made and when we desired rest we would let the night return you moved me gim said legus I've never heard you speak like this before almost you

          make me regret that I've not seen these caves come let's make this bargain if we both return safe out of the perils that await us we'll Journey for a while together you shall visit fangon with me and then I'll come with you to see Helms Deep that would not be the way of return that I should choose said gimy but I'll endure funone if I have your promise to come back to the caves and share their Wonder with me you have my promise said legus but alas now we must leave behind both cave and wood for a while see we're

          
          26:45:14
          coming to the end of the trees how far is it to Eisen guard Gandalf about 15 leagues as the crows of saraban make it said Gandalf five from the mouth of deep in Kum to the forge and 10 more from there to the gates of Eisen guard but we shallan ride all the way this night and when we come there what shall we see said gimy you may know but I can't guess I don't know my myself for certain answered the wizard I was there at nightfall yesterday but much may have happened since yet I think that you will

          
          26:45:51
          not say that the journey was in vain not though the glittering caves of agon be left behind at last the company passed through the trees and found that they had come to the bottom of the Kum where the road from Helms Deep branched going One Way East to aderas and the other North to the Fords of e as as they rode from under the eaves of the wood Legolas halted and looked back with regret then he began a sudden cry there are eyes he said eyes looking out from the Shadows of the boughs I never saw such eyes before the others

          
          26:46:30
          surprised by his cry halted and turned but legala started to ride back no no cried gimy do as you please in your Madness but let me first get down from this horse I wish to see no eyes stay legless Green Leaf said Gandalf don't go back into the wood not yet now is not your time even as he spoke there came forward out of the trees three strange shapes as tall as trolls they were 12T or more in height their strong bodies Stout as young trees seemed to be clad with rment or with hide of close fitting gray and

          
          26:47:09
          brown their limbs were long and their hands had many fingers their hair was stiff and their beards gray green as Moss they gazed out with solemn eyes but they were not looking at the Riders Their Eyes Were bent northwards suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths and sent forth ringing calls clear as notes of a horn but more Musical and various the calls were answered and turning again the rider saw other creatures of the same kind approaching striding through the grass they came swiftly from the

          
          26:47:42
          north walking like wading herens in their gate but not in their speed for their legs and their long Paces beat quicker than the heren wings the Riders cried aloud in Wonder and some set their hands upon their sword hilts you need no weapons said Gandalf these are but herdsmen they're not enemies indeed they're not concerned with us at all so it seemed to be for as he spoke the tall creatures without a glance at the Riders stroe into the wood and vanished herdsmen said theodan where are their flocks what are they Gandalf for

          
          26:48:21
          it's plain that to you at any rate they're not strange they are the Shepherds of the trees answered Gandalf is it so long since you listened to Tales by the Fireside there are children in your land who out of the Twisted threads of story could pick the answer to your question you have seen ANS O King ANS of fangor forest which in your tongue you call the Inwood did you think that the name was given only in idle fancy nay Theoden it is otherwise to them you are but the passing tale all the years from a the

          
          26:48:58
          young to theod and the old are of little count to them and all the Deeds of your house but a small matter the King was silent h he said at length Out of the Shadows Of Legend I begin a little to understand the Marvel of the trees I think I've lived to see Strange Days long we've tended our beasts in our Fields built our houses rought our tools or ridden away to help in the wars of Min tith and that we called the life of men The Way of the World we cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our

          
          26:49:34
          land songs we have that tell of these things but we are forgetting them teaching them only to children as a careless C and now the songs have come down among us out of strange places and walk visible Under the Sun you should be glad Theoden King said Gandalf for not only the little life of men is now endangered but the life also of those things which you have deemed the matter of Legend You're Not Without allies even if you know them not yet also I should be sad said Theoden for however the fortune of War shall go may

          
          26:50:14
          it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful should Pass forever out of Middle Earth it may said Gandalf the evil of saon cannot be wholly cured nor made as if it had not been but to such days we are doomed let us now go on with the journey we've begun the company turned then away from the Kum and from the wood and took the road toward the Fords Lego followed reluctantly the sun had set already it had sunk behind the rim of the world but as they rode out from the shadow of the hills and looked West to the Gap of

          
          26:50:52
          Rohan the sky was still red and a burning light was under the floating clouds dark against it there wheeled and flew many black-winged birds some passed overhead with mournful cries returning to their homes among the rocks the car and foul have been busy about the battlefield said Elma they rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plains about them the slow Moon mounted now waxing towards the full and in its cold silver light the swelling grasslands Rose and fell like a wide gray sea they' ritten for some 4 hours from

          
          26:51:32
          the branching of the roads when they drew near to the Fords long slopes ran swiftly Down To Where the River spread in Stony shs between High grassy Terraces born upon the wind they heard the howling of wolves their hearts were heavy remembering the many men that had fallen in battle in this place the road dipped between Rising Turf Banks carving its way through The Terraces to The River's Edge and up again upon the further side there were three lines of flat Stepping Stones across the stream and between them Fords

          
          26:52:09
          for horses that went from either Brink to a bare a in the midst the Riders looked down upon the crossings and it seemed strange to them for the Fords had ever been a Place full of the rush and a chatter of water upon stones but now they were silent the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare waste of shingles and gray sand this has become a dreary Place said Amma what sickness has befallen the river many Fair things San has destroyed as he devoured the Springs of Eisen too so it would seem said Gandalf alas said

          
          26:52:51
          theodon must we pass this way where the caran beasts devour so many good Riders of the mark this is our way said Gandalf Grievous is the fall of your men but you shall see that at least the Wolves of the mountains do not devour them it is with their friends the Orcs that they hold their feast such indeed is the Friendship of their kind come they rode down to the river and as they came the Wolves ceased their howling and slunk away fear fell on them seeing Gandalf in the moon and shadowfax his horse shining like silver the Riders

          
          26:53:30
          passed over to the iset and glittering eyes watched them wly from the Shadows of the bank look said Gandalf friends have labored here and they saw that in the midst of the at a mound was piled ringed with stones and set about with many Spears here lie all the men of the mark that fell near this place said Gandalf here let them rest said Amma and when their Spears of rotted and rusted long still May their Mount stand and guard the Fords of Eisen is this your work also gandal my friend said theodon you accomplished

          
          26:54:10
          much in an evening and a night with the help of shadowfax and others said Gandalf I rode fast and far but here beside the mound I'll say this for your comfort many fell in the battles of the Fords but fewer than romor made them more were scattered than were slain I gathered together all that I could find some men I sent with grimbold of westfold to join Eren brand some I set to make this burial they have now followed your Marshall elfhelm I sent him with many riders to edus San I knew had dispatched his full strength against

          
          26:54:48
          you and his servants had turned aside from all their errands and gone to Helms Deep the land seemed empty of enemies yet I feared that Wolf Riders and plunderers might ride nonetheless to medel while it was undefended but now I think you need not fear you'll find your house to welcome your return and glad shall I be to see it again said the though brief now I doubt not shall be my abiding there with that the company said farewell to the island and the mound and passed over the river and climbed the

          
          26:55:25
          further bank then they rode on glad to have left the mournful Fords as they went the howling of the Wolves broke out a new there was an ancient Highway that ran down from eard to The Crossings but some way at took its course beside the river bending with it east and then North but at the last it turned away and went straight towards the gates of I andard and these were under the mountain side in the west of the Valley 16 miles or more from its mouth this road they followed but they did not ride upon it

          
          26:56:02
          for the ground beside it was firm and level covered for many miles about with short springing Turf they rode now more swiftly and by midnight the Fords when they five leagues behind then they halted ending their night's Journey for the King was weary they were come to the feet of the Misty Mountains and the long arms of Nan coronia stretched down to meet them dark lay the veil before them for the moon had passed into the west and its light was hidden by the hills but out of the deep shadow of the

          
          26:56:37
          Dale Rose a vast Spire of smoke and Vapor as it mounted it caught the Rays of the sinking Moon and spread in shimmering Billows black and silver over the Starry Sky what do you think of that Gandalf said Aragon one would say that all the Wizard's veil was burning there is ever a fume above the valley in these days said Elmer but I've never seen art like this before these are streams rather than smoke Salamon is brewing some devilry to greet us May maybe he's boiling all the Waters of ion and that's why the river runs

          
          26:57:16
          dry maybe he is said Gandalf tomorrow we shall learn what he's doing but now let's rest for a while if we can they camped beside the bed of the ice and River it was still silent and empty some of them slept a little but late in the night the Watchman cried out and all awoke the moon was gone stars were shining above but over the ground they crept a Darkness blacker than the night on both sides of the river it rolled towards them going northward stay where you are said Gandalf draw no weapons wait and it will pass you

          
          26:57:56
          by a Mist gathered about them above them a few Stars still glimmered faintly but on either side there arose walls of impenetrable Gloom they were in a narrow Lane between moving towers of Shadow voices they heard whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling sigh the Earth shook under them long it seemed to them that they sat and were afraid but at last the darkness and the RoR passed and vanished between the Mountain's arms away South upon the hornberg in the middle night men heard a great noise as

          
          26:58:34
          a wind in the valley and the ground trembled and all were afraid and no one ventured to go forth but in the morning they went out and were amazed for the slain Orcs were gone and the trees also far down into the valley of the deep the grass was crushed and trampled Brown as if giant herdsmen had pastured great droves of cattle there but a mile below the Dyke a huge pit had been delved in the earth and over its Stones were piled into a hill men believed that the Orcs whom they had slain were beded there but

          
          26:59:07
          whether those that had fled into the wood were with them none could say for no man ever set foot upon that Hill the death down it was afterwards called and no grass would grow there but the strange trees were never seen in deep pum again they had returned at night and had gone far away to the dark Dales of fangor thus they were Avenged upon the Orcs the king and his company slept no more that night but they saw and heard no other strange thing save one the voice of the river beside them suddenly

          
          26:59:45
          awoke there was A Rush of water hurrying down among the stones and when it had passed the ice and flowed and bubbled in its bed again as it had ever done at dawn they made ready to go on The Light Came gray and pale and they didn't see the rising of the Sun the air above was Heavy with fog and a reek lay on the land about them they went slowly riding now upon the highway it was Broad and hard and well tendered dimly Through The Mists they could describe the long arm of the mountains Rising on their

          
          27:00:23
          left they had passed into Nan Coria the Wizard's Veil that was a sheltered Valley open only to the South once it had been fair and green and through it the ice and flow already deep and strong before it found the plains for it was fed by many Springs and lesser streams among the rainwashed hills and all about it there had Lain a pleasant fertile land it was not so now beneath the walls of ice and guard there still were acres tilled by the slaves of sodon but most of the valley had become a Wilderness of

          
          27:01:02
          weeds and Thorns brambles trailed upon the ground or clamoring over Bush and Bank made Shaggy caves where small beasts housed no trees grew there but among the rank grasses could still be seen the burned and ax hun stumps of ancient Groves it was a sad country silent now but for the Stony noise of quick Waters smokes and steams drifted in suen clouds and lurked in the hollows the Riders did not speak many doubted in their hearts wondering to what dismal end their Journey LED after they had ridden for some

          
          27:01:42
          months miles the highway became a wide Street paved with great flat Stones squared and laid with skill no blade of grass was seen in any joint deep gutters filled with trickling water ran down on either side suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them it was black and set upon it was a great Stone carved and painted in the likeness of a long white hand its finger pointed North not far now they knew that the gates of ice andard must stand and their hearts were heavy but their eyes could not Pierce

          
          27:02:19
          The Mists ahead beneath the Mountain's arm within the Wizard's Veil through years uncounted had stood that ancient place that men called Eisen guard partly it was shaped in the making of the mountains but Mighty works the men of westernness had wrought there of old and San had dwelt there long and had not been idle this was its fashion while Salamon was at his height accounted by many the chief of wizards a great Ring wall of stone like towering Cliffs stood out from the shelter of the mountain side

          
          27:02:55
          from which it ran and then returned again one entrance only was there made in it a great arch delved in the Southern Wall here through the Black Rock a long tunnel had been H closed at either end with Mighty doors of iron they were so BR and poised upon their huge hinges posts of Steel driven into the living stone that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms noiselessly one who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel beheld a plane a great circle somewhat hollowed

          
          27:03:33
          like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim once it had been green and filled with Avenues and Groves of fruit ful trees watered by streams that flowed from the mountains to a lake but no green thing grew there in the latter days of Salamon the roads were paved with stone Flags dark and hard and beside their borders instead of trees there marched long lines of pillars some of marble some of copper and of iron joined by heavy chains many houses there were Chambers halls and passages cut and tunnel back

          
          27:04:12
          back into the walls upon their inner side so that all the open circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors thousands could dwell there workers servants slaves and warriors with great store of arms wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath the plain too was bored and delved shafts were driven deep into the ground their upper ends were covered by low mounds and domes of stone so that in the Moonlight the ring of ice and guard looked like a graveyard of unquiet dead for the ground trembled the shafts ran

          
          27:04:49
          down by many slopes and spidal stairs to Caverns far under there San had treasuries storehouses armories smithies and great furnaces iron Wheels revolved there endlessly and hammers thudded at night plums of vapor steamed from the vents lit from beneath with red light or blue of venomous green to the center all the roads ran between their chains there stood a tower of marvelous shape it was fashioned by the Builders of old who smoothed The Ring Of Ice And God and yet it seemed a thing not made by the craft of men but driven from the

          
          27:05:32
          bones of the earth and the ancient torment of the hills a peak and aisle of rock it was black and gleaming hard four Mighty peers of many sided Stone were welded into one but near the summit they opened into gaping horns their Pinnacles sharp as the points of Spears Keen edged as knives between them was a narrow space and there upon a floor of polished Stone written with strange signs a man might stand 500 ft above the plain this was orun the Citadel of Salamon the name of which had by Design or chance a two-fold meaning for in the

          
          27:06:14
          Elish speech orank signifies Mount Fang but in the language of the mark of old the cunning mind a strong place and wonderful was Eisen God and long it had been beautiful and there great Lords had dwelt the wardens of Gondor upon the west and wise men that watch the stars but Salamon had slowly shaped it to his shifting purposes and made it better as he thought being deceived for all those arts and subtle devices for which he forsook his former wisdom and which fondly he imagined were his own came but from Mordor so that

          
          27:06:56
          what he made was not only a little copy a child's model or a slave's flattery of that vast Fortress Armory prison furnace of great power barad door The Dark Tower which suffered no right rival and laughed at flattery Bing its time secure in its pride and its immeasurable strength this was the stronghold of Saron as Fame reported it for within living memory the men of Rohan had not P its Gates save perhaps a few such as worm Tong who came in secret and told no man what they saw now Gandalf rode to the great pillar

          
          27:07:41
          of the hand and passed it and as he did so the Riders saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer white it was stained as with dried blood and looking closer they perceived that its nails were red unheeding Gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him all about them now as if there had been a sudden flood Wide pools of water lay beside the road filling the hollows and drills went trickling down among the stones at last Gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they came and saw

          
          27:08:20
          that Beyond him The Mists had cleared and a pale sunlight Shone the hour of noon had passed they were come to the doors of Eisen guard but the doors lay hled and twisted on the ground and all about Stone cracked and splined into countless Jagged shards were scattered far and wide or piled in ruin heaps the great Arch still stood but it opened now upon a roofless Chasm the tunnel was laid bare and through the cliff-like walls on either side great rents and breaches had been torn their towers were

          
          27:08:55
          beaten to dust if the great sea had risen in wroth and fallen on the hills with storm it could have worked no greater ruin the ring Beyond was filled with steaming water a bubbling cauldron in which they heaved and Flo Ed a wreckage of beams and Spar chests and cks and broken gear twisted and leaning pillars reared their splinted stems above the flood but all the roads were drowned far off it seemed half failed in Winding Cloud there loomed the Island Rock still dark and Tall Unbroken by the storm the Tower of orank stood pale

          
          27:09:37
          Waters leapt about its feet the king and all his company sat silent on their horses marveling perceiving that the power of San was overthrown but how they could not guess and now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined Gates there they saw close beside them a great Rubble Heap and suddenly they were aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease gray clad hardly to be seen among the stones there were bottles and bowls and platters laid beside them as if they had just eaten well and now

          
          27:10:15
          rested from their labor one seemed asleep the other with crossed legs and arms behind his head leaned back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth long wisps and little rings of Thin Blue Smoke For a Moment Theoden and Amma and all his men stared at them in Wonder amid all the wreck of eyes and God this seemed to them the strangest sight but before the King could speak the small smoke breathing figure became suddenly aware of them as they sat there silent on the edge of the Mist he sprang to his

          
          27:10:50
          feet a young man he looked or like one though not much more than half a man in height his head of brown curling hair was uncovered but he was clad in a travel stained cloak of the same Hue and shape as the companions of Gandalf had warn when they rode to adoras he bowed very low putting his hand on his breast then seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends he turned to Amma and the King welcome my lords to Eisen guard he said we are the door wardens Mar adic son of sadok is my name and my companion

          
          27:11:30
          who alas is overcome with weariness he gave the other a dig with his foot is peragon son of Paladin of the House of TK far in the north is our our home the Lord San is within but at the moment he is closeted with one Worm tongue or doubtless he would be here to welcome such honorable guests doubtless he would laughed Gandalf and was it camon that ordered you to guard his damaged doors and watch for the arrival of guests when your attention could be spared from plate and bottle no good sir the matter escaped

          
          27:12:09
          him answered Mary Gravely he has been much occupied our orders came from Treebeard who has taken over the management of Eisen guard he commanded me to welcome the Lord of Rowan with fitting words I've done my best and what about your companions what about legus and me cried gimy unable to contain himself longer you Rascals you woolly footed and wool pained truin a fine hunt you've L us 200 Le through fed and Forest battle and death to rescue you and here we find you feasting and idling and smoking smoking where did you

          
          27:12:51
          come by the weed of villains hammer and tongs I'm so torn between rage and joy that if I do not burst it will be a Marvel you speak for me gimy laughed legalis though I would sooner learn how they came by the wine one thing you've not found in your hunting and that's brighter wits said Pippen opening an eye hey you find us sitting on a field of Victory amid the plunder of armies and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned Comforts well earned said gimy I can't believe that the Riders laughed it

          
          27:13:28
          cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear friends said theodan so these are the Lost Ones of your company gandal the days are fated to be filled with Marvels already I've seen many since I left my house and now here before my eyes stand yet another of the folk of Legend are not these the halflings that some Among Us call the hitlan hobbits if you please Lord said Pippen Hobbits said Theon your tongue is strangely changed but the name sounds not unfitting so Hobbits no report that I've heard does Justice to the truth

          
          27:14:09
          medy bowed and Pippen got and bowed low you're gracious Lord or I hope that I may so take your words he said and here's another Marvel I've wandered in Many Lands since I left my home and never till now have I found people that knew any story concerning Hobbits my people came out of the North long ago said theodan but I'll not deceive you we know no tales about Hobbits all that is said among us is that far away over many Hills and Rivers live the halfling folk that dwell in holes in sand dunes but there are no

          
          27:14:45
          Legends of their deeds for it said that they do little and avoid the sight of men being able to vanish in a twinkling and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds but it seems that more could be said it could indeed lord said Mary for one thing said Theoden I hadn't heard that they spouted smoke from their mouths that's not surprising answered Mary for it's an art which we have not practiced for more than a few Generations it was toe bold Hornblower or long bottom in the South faring who

          
          27:15:22
          first grew the true pipe weed in his Gardens about the year 170 according to our Reckoning how old Toby came by the plant you don't know your danger theen interrupted Gandalf these Hobbits will sit on the edge of Ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table all the small doings of their fathers grandfathers and great-grandfathers and remoter cousins to the ninth degree if you encourage them with undue patience some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking where's tree beard Mary away on

          
          27:15:59
          the North side I believe he went to get a drink of Clean Water most of the other ants are with him still busy at their work over there Mary waved his hand towards the steaming Lake and as they looked they heard a distant rumbling and rattling as if an avalanche was falling from the mountain side far away came a h wh as of horns blowing triumphantly and is orun then left unguarded asked Gandalf there's the water said Mary but quick beam and some others are watching it not all those posts and pillars in

          
          27:16:36
          the plain are of San's planting quick beam I think is by The Rock near the foot of the stair yes a tall gray an is there said Legolas but his arms are at his sides and he stands as still as a door tree it is past noon said Gandalf and we at any rate have not eaten since early morning yet I wish to see Tre beard as soon as maybe did he leave me no message or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind he left a message said Mary and I was coming to it but but I've been hindered by many other questions I was

          
          27:17:14
          to say that if the lord of the mark and Gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find tree beard there and he'll welcome them I may add that they'll also find food at the best there it was discovered and selected by your humble servants he bowed Gandalf laughed that's better he said well Theoden will you ride with me to find tree beard we must go roundabout but it's not far when you see tree beard you will learn much for tree beard is fangor and the eldest and chief of the ants and when you speak

          
          27:17:50
          with him you will hear the speech of the oldest of all living things I will come with you said Thon Farewell My Hobbits may we meet again in my house there you shall sit beside me and tell me all that your hearts desire the Deeds of your grandsires as far as you can reckon them and we will speak also of toold the old and his herbl Farewell the hobbits bowed low so that is the king of Rohan said Pippen in an undertone a fine old fellow very polite chapter nine Flom and Jetsam gandal from the king's company

          
          27:18:35
          rode away turning Eastward to make the Circuit of the ruined walls of E andard but Aragon gim and legalis remained behind leaving arod and hasselt to stray in search of grass they came and set beside the hobbits well well the Hunt is over and we meet again at last where none of us ever thought to come said Aragon and now that the great ones have gone to discuss High matters said legalis the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles we tracked you as far as the forest but there are still many things that I

          
          27:19:12
          should like to know the truth of and there's a great deal too that we want to know about you said Mary we've learned a few things through tree beard the old int but that's not nearly enough all in good time said lialis we were the hunters and you should give an account of yourselves to us first or second said gimy it would go better after a meal I have a sore head and it's past midday you truants might make amends by finding a sum of the plunder that you spoke of food and drink would pay off some of my

          
          27:19:49
          score against you then you shall have it said Pippen will you have it here or in more comfort in what's left of San's God house over there under the arch we had to picnic out here so as to keep an eye on the road less than an ie said gimy but I'll not go into an or house nor touch Orcs meat or anything that they've molded we wouldn't ask you to do that said Mary we've had enough of Orcs ourselves to last a lifetime but there were many other folk in Eisen guard San kept enough wisdom not to trust his Orcs

          
          27:20:26
          he had men to guard his Gates some of his most Faithful Servants I suppose anyway they were favored and got good provisions and pipe weed asked gimy no I don't think so Mary laughed but that's another story which can wait until after lunch well let's go and have lunch then said the dwarf the hobbits led the way and they passed under the arch and came to a wide door upon the left at the top of a stair it opened direct into a large chamber with other smaller doors at the far end and a hearth and chimney at one side the

          
          27:21:05
          chamber was heun out of the stone and it must once have been dark for its Windows looked out only into the tunnel but light came in now through the broken roof on the Hearth wood was burning I lit a bit of fire said Pippen it cheered us up in the fogs there were few about and most of the wood we could find was wet but there's a great draft in the chimney it seems to wind away up through the rock unfortunately it hasn't been blocked a fire is handy I will make you some toast the bread is three or 4 days

          
          27:21:41
          old I'm afraid Aragorn and His companion sat themselves down at one end of a long table and The Hobbit disappeared through one of the inner doors store room and there and above the floods luckily said Pippen as they came back Laden with dishes bowls cups knives and food of various sorts and you needn't turn up your nose at the provender master gimy said Mary this is not orc stuff but man food as tree beard called calls it will you have wine or beer there's a barrel inside there very passible and this is First

          
          27:22:18
          Rate salted pork or I can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them if you like I'm sorry there's no green stuff the deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days I can't offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread are you content indeed yes said gimy the score is much reduced the three were soon busy with their meal and the two Hobbits unabashed set to a second time we must keep our guests company they said you're full of courtesy this morning laughed legus but maybe if we

          
          27:22:58
          hadn't arrived you'd already have been keeping one another company again maybe and why not said Pippen we had foul fair with the Orcs And little enough for days before that it seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content it doesn't seem to have done you any harm said Aragon indeed you look in the bloom of Health I you do indeed said gimly looking them up and down over the top of his cup why your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted and I would swear that you both grown somewhat

          
          27:23:33
          if that's possible for Hobbits of your age this tree beard at any rate has not starved you he hasn't said Mary but an only drink and drink isn't enough for Content Trey Beard's drafts may be nourishing but one feels the need of something solid and even lmas is none the worse for a change you've drunk of the Waters of the ants have you said Legolas ah then I think it's likely that gim's eyes don't deceive him strange songs have been sung of the drafts of fangor many Strange Tales have been told about that land

          
          27:24:11
          said Aragon I've never entered it come tell me more about it and about the ants ants said Pippin ants are well ants are all different for one thing but their eyes now their eyes are very odd he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence oh well he went on you've seen some at a distance already they saw you at any rate and reported that you were on the way and you'll see many others I expect before you leave here you must form your own ideas no no said gimy we're beginning the story in the middle I should like a

          
          27:24:52
          tale in the right order starting with that Strange Day when our fellowship was broken you shall have it if there is time said Mary but first if you finished eating you shall fill your pipes and light up and then for a little while we can pretend that we're all back safe at Brie again or in Rivendell he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco we have heaps of it he said and you can all pack as much as you wish when we go we did some Salvage work this morning Pippen to die there are lots of things floating about it was Pippen who

          
          27:25:31
          found two small barrels washed up out of some Cellar or Storehouse I suppose when we opened them we found they were filled with this as fine a pipe weed as you could wish for and quite unspoiled gimy took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it it feels good and it smells good he said it is good said Mary my dear gimy it is a long bottom Leaf there were the Hornblower brand marks on the barrels as plain as plain how it came here I can't imagine for San's private use I fancy I never knew that it went so far abroad but it

          
          27:26:11
          comes in handy now it would said gimy if I had a pipe to go with it alas I lost mine in Moria more before is there no pipe in all your plunder no I'm afraid not said Mary we've not found any not even here in the guard rooms San kept this dainty to himself it seems and I don't think it would be any use knocking on the doors of orthon to beg a pipe of him we shall have to share pipes as good friends must at a pinch half a moment said Pippen putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he pulled out a

          
          27:26:49
          little soft wallet on a string I keep a treasure or two near my skin as precious as rings to me here's one my old wooden pipe and here's another an unused one I've carried it a long way though I don't know why I never really expected to find any pipe weed on the journey when my own ran out but now it comes in useful after all he held up a small pipe with a wide flattened bowl and handed it to gimy does that settle the score between us he said settle it cried gimly most noble Hobbit it leaves me deep in your debt

          
          27:27:28
          well I'm going back into the open air to see what the wind and sky are doing said legalis we'll come with you said Aragorn they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the Gateway they could see far down into the valley Now The Mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze now let's take our ease here for a little said Aragon we'll sit on the edge of Ruin and talk as Gandalf says while he's busy elsewhere I feel a weariness such as I've seldom felt before he wrapped his gray cloak about

          
          27:28:03
          him hiding his mail shirt and stretched out his long legs then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke look said Pippen stride of the Rangers come back he's never been away said Aragon I am Strider and dadan to and I belong both to Gondor and the north they smoked in silence for a while and the sun Shone on them slanting into the valley from among white clouds high in the west legalis lay still looking up at the Sun and sky with with steady eyes and singing softly to himself at last he sat

          
          27:28:46
          up come now he said time wears on and The Mists are blowing away or would if you strange folk didn't wathe yourselves in Smoke what of the tale well my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all strung up in an orc Camp said Pippin let me see what's today the 5th of March and the shy Reckoning said Aragorn Pippin made some calculations on his fingers only 9 days ago he said it seems a year since we were caught well though half of it was like a bad dream I reckon that three very horrible days followed Mary will

          
          27:29:28
          correct me if I forget anything important I'm not going into details the whips and the filth and stench and all that it doesn't bear remembering with that he plunged into on account of boromir's last fight and the orc March from Emin wheel to the forest the others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses here are some Treasures that you let fall said Aragon you'll be glad to have them back he loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it the two sheathed knives well said Mary I never expected

          
          27:30:06
          to see those again I marked a few Orcs with mine but UK took them from us how he glared at first I thought he was going to stab me but he threw the things away as if they burned him and here is also your brooch Pippen said Aragorn I've kept it safe for it's a very precious thing I know said Pippen it was a wrench to Let It Go but what else could I do nothing else answered Aragon one who can't Cast Away a treasure at need is in Fetters you said rightly The Cutting of the bands on your wrists that was smart

          
          27:30:44
          work said gimy luck served you there but you seized your chance with both hands one might say and set us a pretty riddle said Legolas I wondered if you'd grown Wings unfortunately not said Pippen but you didn't know about grishnak he shuted and said no more leaving Mary to tell her those last horrible moments the pouring hand the hot breath and the Dreadful stench of gnar's hairy arms all this about the Orcs of barad l b as they call it makes me uneasy said Aragorn the dark lord all read in you

          
          27:31:25
          too much and his servants also and grishnak evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel the red eyee will be looking towards Eisen guard but San at any rate is in a cliff stick of his own cutting yes whichever side winds his outlock is poor said Mary things began to go all wrong for him from the moment his orc set foot in Rowan we caught a glimpse of the old villain also gandalin said gimy on the edge of the forest when was that asked Pippin five nights ago said Aragon let me see said Mary five nights ago now we

          
          27:32:05
          come to a part of the story you know nothing about we met tree beard that morning after the battle and that night we were at Welling Hall one of his an houses the next morning we went to an moot a gathering of ents that is and the queerest thing I've ever seen in my life it lasted all that day in the next and we spent the nights with an INT called quick beam and then late in the afternoon in the third day of their moot the an suddenly blew up it was amazing the forest had felt as tense as as if a

          
          27:32:40
          thunderstorm was brewing inside it then all at once it exploded I wish you could have heard their song as they marched if Salamon had heard it he would be a 100 miles away by now even if he had had to run on his own legs said Pippin thou eyes and guard be strong and hard as cold as Stone and bear as bone we go we go we go to war to heue the stone and break the door there was very much more a great deal of the song had no words and was like a music of horns and drums it was very exciting but I thought it was only marching music and

          
          27:33:21
          no more just a song until I got here I know better now we came down over the last Ridge into Nan coroner after night had fallen Mary continued it was then that I first had the feeling that the forest itself was moving behind us I thought I was dreaming an entish dream but Pippen had noticed it too we were both frightened but we didn't find out more about it until later it was the horns or so the ants call them in short language tree beard won't say much about them but I think they're ants that have become almost

          
          27:33:59
          like trees at least to look at they stand here and there in the wood or under its Eaves silent watching endlessly over the trees but deep in the darkest Dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them I believe there's a great power in them and they seem able to wrap themselves in Shadow it's difficult to see them moving but they do they can move very quickly if they're angry you stand still looking at the weather maybe or listening to the rustling of the wind and then suddenly you find that you're in the middle of a

          
          27:34:31
          wood with great groping trees all around you they still have voices and can speak with the ants that's why they are called horns tree bird says but they have become queer and wild dangerous I should be terrified of meeting them if there were no true ants about to look after them well in the early night we crept down a Long Ravine into the upper end of the Wizard's Veil The Ant with all their rustling horns behind them we couldn't see them of course but the whole air was full of creaking it was very dark a

          
          27:35:06
          cloudy night they moved at a great speed as soon as they lift the hills and made a noise like a rushing wind the moon didn't appear through the clouds and not long after midnight there was a tall wood all around the north side of Eisen guard there was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge there was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower that was all tree beard and a few more ants crept on right round to within sight of the great Gates Pippen and I were with him we were sitting on tree

          
          27:35:39
          Beard's shoulders and I could feel the quivering tenseness in him but even when they're aroused ants can be very cautious and patient they stood still as carved Stones breathing and listening then all at once there was a tremendous stir trumpets blared and the walls of Eisen guard echoed we thought that we'd been discovered and that battle was going to begin but nothing of the sort all San's people were marching away I don't know much about this war or about the horsemen of Rohan but San seems to have meant to finish off the

          
          27:36:18
          king and all his men with one final blow he emptied Eisen guard I saw the enemy Go endless lines of marching Orcs And troops of them mounted on great wolves and there were battalions of men too many of them carried torches and in the flare I could see their faces most of them were ordinary men rather tall and darkhaired and Grim but not particularly evil looking but there were some others that were horrible man high but with Goblin faces sow learing squint eyed you know they reminded me at once of that

          
          27:36:56
          Southerner at Brie only he was not so obviously orc like as most of these were I thought of him too said Aragon we had many of these half ORS to deal with at Helms Deep it seems plain now that that Southerner was a spy of camans but whether he was working with the Black Riders or for camon alone I don't know it's difficult with these evil folk to know when they're in league and when they are cheating one another Well of All Sorts together there must have been 10,000 at the very least said Mary they

          
          27:37:32
          took an hour to pass out of the gates some went off down the highway to the Fords and some turned away and went Eastward a bridge has been built down there about a mile away where the river runs in a very deep Channel you could see it now if you stood up they were all singing with harsh voices and laughing making a hideous din I thought things looked very black for Rohan but tree beard didn't move he said my business is with Eisen guard tonight with rock and stone but though I couldn't see what was

          
          27:38:08
          happening in the dark I believed that horns began to move South as soon as the gates were shut again their business was with Orcs I think they were far down the valley in the morning or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldn't see through as soon as San had sent off his army our turn came tree beard put us down and went up to the gates and began hammering on the doors and calling for Saron there was no answer except arrows and stones from the walls but arrows are no use against ants they hurt them of

          
          27:38:44
          course and infuriate them like stinging flies but an an can be stuck as full of orc arrows as a pin cushion and take no serious harm they can't be poisoned for one thing and their skin seems to be very thick and tougher than bark it takes a very heavy ax stroke to wound them seriously they don't like axes but there would have to be a great many Ax Men to one ant a man that hacks once at an ant never gets a chance of a second blow a punch from an ant fist crumples up iron like thin tin when tree beard had got a few arrows

          
          27:39:24
          in him he began to warm up to get positively Hasty as he would say he let out a great home home and a dozen more ants came striding up an angry ant is terrifying their fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock and they tear it up like bread crusts it was like watching the work of great tree roots in a 100 years all packed into a few moments they pushed pulled tore Shook and hammered and clang bang crash trck in five minutes they had these huge Gates just lying in ruin and some were already beginning to eat into the walls

          
          27:40:06
          like rabbits in a sand pit I don't know what San thought was happening but anyway he didn't know how to deal with it his Wizardry may have been falling off lately of course but anyway I think he hasn't much grit not much plain courage alone in a tight place without a lot of slaves and machines and things if you know what I mean very different from old gandal I wonder if his Fame was not all along mainly due to his cleverness in settling at Eisen guard no said Aragon once he was as great as his Fame made

          
          27:40:42
          him his knowledge was deep his thought was subtle and His Hands marvelously skilled and he had a power over the minds of others the wise he could persuade and the smaller folk he could daunt that power he certainly still keeps there are not many in Middle Earth that I should say were safe if they were left alone to talk with him even now when he has suffered a defeat Gandalf elrond and gadriel perhaps now that his wickedness has been laid bare but very few others the answer are safe said Pippen he seems at one time to have got

          
          27:41:18
          round them but never again and anyway he didn't understand them and he made the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations he had no plan for them and there was no time to make any once they'd set to work as soon as our attack began the few remaining rats in Eisen guard started bolting through every hole that the made the ants let the men go after they'd questioned them two or three dozen only down at this end I don't think many orc folk of any size escaped not from the horns there was a wood full of them all

          
          27:41:54
          around Eis andard by that time as well as those that had gone down the valley when the ant had reduced a large part of the Southern walls to rubbish and what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him Saran fled in panic he seems to have been at the gates when we arrived I expect he came to watch his Splendid Army march out when the ants broke their way in he left in a hurry they didn't spot him at first but the night had opened out and there was a great light of stars quite enough for inst to see by and suddenly quick beam

          
          27:42:30
          gave a cry the tree killer the tree killer quick beam is a gentle creature but he hates Saron all the more fierce ly for that his people suffered cruy from orc axes he leapt down the path from the inner gate and he can move like a wind when he's roused there was a pale figure hurrying Away In and Out of the Shadows of the pillar and it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower top but it was a near thing quick beam was so hot after him that he was within a step or two of being caught and strangled when he

          
          27:43:05
          slipped in through the door when San was safe back in in orthon it wasn't long before he set some of his precious Machinery to work by that time there were many ant inside Eisen guard some had followed quick beam and others had burst in from the north and east they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage suddenly up came fires and foul fumes the vents and shafts all over the plane began to spout and belch several of the ants got scorched and blistered one of them Peach bone I think he was called a very tall

          
          27:43:42
          handsome an got caught in a spray of some Liquid Fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight that sent them mad I thought that they'd been really roused before but I was wrong I saw what it was like at last it was staggering they roared and boomed and trumpeted until Stones began to crack and fall at the mere noise of them Mary and I lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears round and round the rock of orthon the an went striding and storming like a howling Gale breaking pillers hurling

          
          27:44:18
          Avalanches of Boulders down the shafts tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves the tower was in the middle of a spinning Whirlwind I saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orank but tree beard kept his head he hadn't got any Burns luckily he didn't want his folk to hurt themselves in their Fury and he didn't want San to escape out of some hole in the confusion many of the ants were hurling themselves against The orthant Rock but

          
          27:44:54
          that defeated them it's very smooth and hard some Wizardry is in it perhaps older and stronger than camans anyway they couldn't get a grip on it or make a crack in it and they were bruising and wounding themselves against it so tree beard went out into the ring and shouted his enormous voice Rose above all the den there was a dead silence suddenly in it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower that had a queer effect on the ants they'd been boiling over now they became cold Grim as ice and

          
          27:45:33
          quiet they left the plane and gathered round tree beard standing quite still he spoke spoke to them for a little in their own language I think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his old head long before then then just faded silently away in the gray light day was Dawning by that time they set a watch on the tower I believe but the Watchers were so well hidden in Shadows and kept so still that I couldn't see them the others went away North all that day they were busy out of sight most of the time we were left

          
          27:46:10
          alone it was a dreary day and we wandered about a bit though we kept out of the view of the windows of orthon as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly a good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat and also we sat and talked wondering what was happening away South in Rowan and what had become of all the rest of our company every now and then we could hear in the distance the Ratt and fall of stone and thating noises echoing in the hills in the afternoon we walked around

          
          27:46:47
          the circle and went to have a look at what was going on there was a great shadowy wood of horns at the head of the valley and another around the northern wall we didn't dare to go in but there was a rending tearing noise of work going on inside ant and horns were digging great pits and trenches and making great pools and dams Gathering all the Waters of the Eisen and every other spring and stream that they could find we left them to it at dusk tree beard came back to the gate heg was humming and booming to

          
          27:47:23
          himself and he seemed pleased he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deep I asked him if he was tired tired he said tired well no not tired but stiff I need a good draft of an wash we've worked hard we've done more Stone cracking and Earth knowing today than we've done in many a long year before but it's nearly finished when night falls don't linger near this gate or in the old tunnel water may come through and it'll be foul water for a while until all the filth of Saron is washed

          
          27:47:59
          away then Eisen can run clean again he began to pull down a bit more of the walls in a leisurely sort of way just to amuse himself we were just wondering where it would be safe to lie and get some sleep when the most amazing thing of all happened there was the sound of a rider coming swiftly up the road Mary and I L quied and tree beard hid himself in the Shadows on the arch suddenly a great horse came striding up like a flash of silver it was already dark but I could see the rider's face clearly it seemed

          
          27:48:35
          to shine and all his clothes were white I just just sat up staring with my mouth open I tried to call out and couldn't there was no need he halted just by us and looked down at us gandal I said at last but my voice was only a whisper did he say hello Pippen this is a pleasant surprise now indeed he said get up you Tom fool of a toque where in the name of wonder in all this ruin is tree beard I want him quick tree beard heard his voice and came out of the Shadows at once and there was a strange meeting I was surprised because neither

          
          27:49:20
          of them seemed surprised at all Gandalf obviously expected to find tree beard here and tree beard might almost have been lering about near the gates on purpose to meet him yet we'd told the old int all about Moria but then I remembered a queer look he gave us at the time I can only suppose that he'd seen gandal or had some news of him but wouldn't say anything in a hurry don't be Hasty is his motto but nobody not even elves will say much about Gandalf's movements when he's not there home gandal said tree beard I'm

          
          27:50:02
          glad you've come wood and water stock and stone I can Master but there is a WI to manage here tree beard said Gandalf I need your help you've done much but I need more I have about 10,000 Orcs to manage then those two went off and had a council together in some corner it must have seemed very Hasty to tree beard for Gandalf was in a tremendous hurry and was already talking at a great Pace before they passed out of hearing they were only away a matter of minutes per perhaps quarter of an hour then Gandalf came back to us and he

          
          27:50:43
          seemed relieved almost merry he did say he was glad to see us then but Gandalf I cried where have you been and have you seen the others wherever I have been I am back he answered in the genuine gandal manner yes I've seen some of the Riders but news must wait this is a perilous night and I must ride fast but the dawn may be brighter and and if so we shall meet again take care of yourselves and keep away from orun goodbye Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone he'd evidently learned a lot in a short time

          
          27:51:23
          and was digesting it he looked at us and said H well I find you're not such Hasty folk as I thought you said much less than you might but not more than you should H this is a bundle of news and no mistake well now tree beard must get busy again before he went we got a little news out of him and it didn't cheer us up at all but for the moment we thought more about you three than about Frodo and Sam or about poor barir for we gathered that there was a great battle going on or soon would be and that you

          
          27:52:01
          were in it and might never come out of it horns will help said tree bid then he went away and we didn't see him again until this morning it was deep night we lay on top of a pile of stone and we could see nothing Beyond it m or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all around us the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full of rustlings creakings and a murmur like voices passing I think that hundreds more of the horns must have been passing by to help in the battle later there were a great Rumble

          
          27:52:39
          of Thunder away South and flashes of lightning far away across Rohan every now and then we could see mountain peaks Miles and Miles Away stab out suddenly black and white and then vanish and behind us there were noises like thunder in Hills but different at times the whole valley echoed it must have been about midnight when the ants broke the dams and poured all the gathered Waters through a gap in the northern wall down into e and guard the horn do had passed and the Thunder had rolled away the moon was sinking

          
          27:53:15
          behind the Western mountains ice and guard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools they glittered in the last Light of the Moon as they spread over the Plaine every now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or spout hole great white steams hissed up smoke Rose in pillows there were explosions and gusts of fire one great coil of vapor went whiring up twisting round and round orthon until it looked like a tall peak of cloud fiery underneath and moon it above and still more water poured in

          
          27:53:55
          until at last Eisen guard looked like a huge flat saucepan all steaming and bubbling we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we came to the mouth of Nan corer said Aragon we feared that sadon was brewing some new devilry for us not he said Pippen he was probably choking and not laughing anymore by the morning yesterday morning the water had sunk down into all the holes and there was a dense fog we took refuge in that guard room over there and we had rather a fright the lake began to overflow and

          
          27:54:35
          pour out through the old tunnel and the water was rapid rising up the steps we thought we were going to get caught like Orcs in a hole but we found a Winding Stair at the back of the store room that brought us out at the top of the arch it was a squeeze to get out as the passages had been cracked and half blocked with Fallen Stone near the top there we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of ice andard the ends kept on pouring in more water till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled

          
          27:55:09
          the fog slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge umbrella of cloud it must have been a mile high in the evening there was a great rainbow over the Eastern Hills and then the sunset was blotted out by a thick drizzle on the mountain sides it all went very quiet a few wolves howled mournfully far away the ant stopped the inflow in the night and sent the ien back into its old course and that was the end of it all since then the water has been sinking again there must be Outlets somewhere from the caves underneath I

          
          27:55:47
          think if San peeps out of any of his windows it must look an untidy dreary mess we felt very lonely not even a visible ant to talk to in all the ruin and no news we spent the night up on top there above the arch and it was cold and damp and we didn't sleep we had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute San still in his Tower there was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley I think the ants and horns that had been away came back then but where they've all gone to now I don't know it was a misty moisty morning

          
          27:56:27
          when we climbed down and looked round again and nobody was about and that is about all there is to tell it seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil and safer too somehow since Gandalf came back I could sleep they all fell silent for a while gimly refilled his pipe there's one thing I wonder about he said as he lit it with his flint and Tinder Worm tongue you told theen he was with seron how did he get there oh yes I forgot about him said Pippen he didn't get here till this morning we just H the fire and had some

          
          27:57:09
          breakfast when tree beard appeared again we heard him Hing and calling our names outside I've just come around to see how you're fairing my Lads he said and to give you some news who horns have come back all's well I very well indeed he laughed and slapped his thighs no more Orcs in ien guard no more axes and there will be folk coming up from the south before the day is old some that you may be glad to see he'd hardly said that when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road we rushed out before the gates and

          
          27:57:46
          I stood and stared half expecting to see strier and gandal come riding up at the head of an army but out of the midst there rode a man on an old tired horse and he looked a queer Twisted sort of creature himself there was no one else when he came out of the Mist and suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him he sat and gaped and his face went almost green he was so bewildered that he didn't seem to notice us at first when he did he gave a cry and tried to turn his horse round and ride off but tree beard took three

          
          27:58:22
          strides put out a long arm and lifted him out of the saddle his horse bolted in Terror and he graveled on the ground he said he was GMA friend and counselor of the king and had been sent with important messages from theodan to Saron no one else would dare to ride through the open land so full of foul Orcs he said so I was sent and I've had a perilous journey and I'm hungry and weary I fled far north out of my way pursued by Wolves I caught the sideways look he gave to tree beard and I said to myself

          
          27:59:01
          liar tree beard looked at him in his long slow way for several minutes till The Wretched Man was squirming on the floor then at last he said huh H I was expecting you master worm Tong the man started at that name Gandalf got here first so I know as much about you as I need and I know what to do with you put all the rats in one trap says Gandalf and I will I am the master of Eis andard now but Saran is locked in his Tower and you can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of let be go

          
          27:59:39
          let me go said Worm tongue I know the way you knew the way I don't doubt said tree beard but things have changed here a little go and see he let worm Tong go and he limped off through the arch with us close behind until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay between him and oron then he turned to us let me go away he whined let me go away my messages are useless now they are indeed said Treebeard but you have only two choices to stay with me until gandal and your master arrive or to

          
          28:00:18
          cross the water which will you have the man shivered At The Mention of his master and put a foot into the water but he drew back I cannot swim he said the water is not deep said tree beard it is dirty but that will not harm you master Worm tongue in you go now with that the wretch floundered off into the flood it rose up nearly to his neck before he got too far away for me to see him the last I saw of him was clinging to some old Barrel or piece of wood but tree beard waited after him and watched

          
          28:00:54
          his progress well he has gone in he said when he returned I saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat there's someone in the tower still a hand came out and pulled him in so there he is and I hope the welcome is to his liking now I must go and wash myself clean of the Slime I'll be a way up on the North side if anyone wants to see me there's no clean water down here fit for an INT to drink or to bathe in so I will ask you two Lads to keep a watch at the gate for the folk that are coming there'll be the

          
          28:01:31
          lord of the fields of Rohan marku you must welcome him as well as you know how his men are fought a great fight with the Orcs maybe you know the right fashion of men's words for such a lord better than ants there have been many lords in the green fields in my time and I've never heard their speech or their names they will be wanting man food and you know all about that I guess so find what you think is Fit For A King to eat if you can and that is the end of the story though I should like to know who

          
          28:02:05
          this wormtongue is was he really the king's counsel he was said Aragon and also San's spy and servant in Rohan fate hasn't been kinder to him than he deserves the sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough but I fear that worse awaits him yes I don't suppose tree beard sent him to orun out of kindness said Mary he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink we spent a busy time after that

          
          28:02:43
          searching the flatsome and rumaging about we found two or three store rooms in different places nearby above the flood level but tree beard sent some inss down and they carried off a great deal of the stuff we want man food for 25 the ant said so you can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived you three were evidently meant to go with the great people but you wouldn't have fared any better we kept as good as we sent I promise you better because we sent no drink what about drink I said to the

          
          28:03:21
          ants there is water of I they said and that is good enough for ants and men but I hope that the ants may have found time to brw some of their drafts from the mountain springs and we shall see Gandalf's beard curling when he returns after the ants had gone we felt tired and hungry but we didn't Grumble our labors had been well rewarded it was through our search for man food that Pippen discovered the prize of all the flatsome those Hornblower barrels pipe weed is better after food said Pippen that is how the situation

          
          28:04:00
          arose we understand it all perfectly now said gimy all except one thing said Aragorn Leaf from the south Farthing in Eisen guard the more I consider it the more Curious I find it I've never been in Eisen guard but I've journeyed in this land and I know well the empty countries that lie between Rohan and the sh neither Goods nor folk have passed that way for many a long year not openly Salamon had secret dealings with someone in the sh I guess worm tongues may be found in other houses than King theodan was there a

          
          28:04:38
          date on the barrels yes said Pippen it was the 1417 crop that is last year's no the year before of course now a Good Year ah well whatever evil was a foot is over now I hope or else it's beyond our reach at present said Aragorn yet I think I shall mention it to Gandalf small matter though it may seem among his great Affairs I wonder what he's doing said Mary the afternoon is getting on let's go and look around you can enter Eisen guard now at any rate Strider if you want to but it's not a very cheerful

          site chapter 10 the voice of sodaman they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones G gazing at the dark Rock of orank and its many windows a menace still in the Desolation that lay all about it the waters had now nearly all subsided here and there gloomy pools remained covered with scum and wreckage but most of the Wide Circle was Bare again A wilderness of slime and tumbled Rock pitted with blackened holes and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that

          
          28:06:08
          at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes like the shingles cast up by a great storm and Beyond them the green and Tangled Valley ran up into the Long Ravine between the dark arms of the mountains across the waist they saw Riders picking their way they were coming from the north side and already they were Drawing Near to orank there is Gandalf and Theoden and his men said Lego let's go and meet them walk weily said Mary there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw you down into a pit if you

          
          28:06:46
          don't take care they followed what was left of the road from the gates to orun going slowly for the flag Stones were cracked and slimed the Riders seeing them approach halted under the shadow of the Rock and waited for them Gandalf rode forward to meet them well tree beard and I have had some interesting discussions and made a few plans he said and we've all had some much needed rest now we must be going on again I hope you companions have all rested too and refreshed yourselves we have said Mary but our discussions began and ended

          
          28:07:27
          in Smoke still we feel less ill disposed towards seron than we did do you indeed said Gandalf well I don't I've now a last task to do before I go I must pay Saran A Farewell visit dangerous and probably useless but it must be done those of you who wish may come with me but beware and don't Gest this isn't the time for it I'll come said gimy I wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you and how would you learn that Master dwarf said Gandalf Aran could look like me in your eyes if it suited his purpose with you

          
          28:08:13
          and are you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits well we shall see perhaps he may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together but I've ordered all the ants to remove themselves from sight so perhaps we should persuade him to come out what's the danger asked Pippen will he shoot at us and pour fire out of the windows or can can he put a spell on us from a distance the last is more likely if you ride to his door with a light heart said Gandalf but there's no knowing what he

          
          28:08:47
          can do or may choose to try a wild beast cornered is not safe to approach and seron has powers you don't guess beware of his voice they came now to the foot of orthon it was black and the rock gleamed as if it were wet the many faces of the Stone had sharp edges as though they hadd been newly chiseled a few scorings and small flak likee splinters near the base were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the ants on the Eastern side in the angle of two peers there was a great door high above the ground and over it was a

          
          28:09:29
          shuted window opening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars up to the threshold of the door there mounted a flight of 20 seven broad stairs he by some unknown art of the same black stone this was the only entrance to the tower but many tall windows were cut with deep embracers in the climbing walls far up they peered like little eyes and the sheer faces of the horns at the foot of the stairs gandal from the King dismounted I'll go up said Gandalf I've been in oron and I know my peril and I too will go up said the king

          
          28:10:10
          I'm old and fear no Peril anymore I wish to speak with the Enemy who has done me so much wrong AA shall come with me and see that my aged feet do not falter as you will said Gandalf Aragon shall come with me let the others await us at the foot of the stairs they'll hear and see enough if there's anything to hear or see nay said gimy legless and I wish for a closer view we alone here represent our kindreds we also will come behind come then said Gandalf and with that he climbed the steps and Theoden

          
          28:10:50
          went beside him the Riders of Rowan sat uneasily upon their horses on either side of the stair and looked up Darkly at the great tower fearing what might befall their lord Mary and Pippen sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and unsafe half a sticky mile from here to the gate muttered Pippen I wish I could slip off back to the guard room unnoticed what did we come for we're not wanted Gandalf stood before the door of orun and beat on it with his staff it rang with a hollow sound Salamon Salamon he cried in

          
          28:11:29
          a loud commanding voice Salamon come forth for some time there was no answer at at last the window above the door was unbarred but no figure could be seen at its dark opening who is it said a voice what do you wish theodon started I know that voice he said and I cursed the day when I first listened to it go and fetch seron since youve become his footman gream a worm tongue said Gandalf and don't waste our time the window closed they waited suddenly another voice spoke low and melodious its very sound and

          
          28:12:14
          enchantment those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldom report the words that they heard and if they did they wondered for little power remained in them mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to hear the voice speaking all that it said seemed wise and reasonable and desire awoke in them by Swift agreement to seem wise themselves when others spoke they seemed harsh and UNC by contrast and if they gainsay The Voice anger was kindled in the hearts of those under the spell for

          
          28:12:47
          some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke to them and when it spoke to another they smiled as men do who see through a juggler's trick While others gape at it for many the sound of the voice alone was enough to hold them enthralled but For Those whom it conquered the spell endured when they were far away and ever they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them but none were unmoved none rejected its pleas and its commands without an effort of mind and will so long as its Master had control of it well it said now with

          
          28:13:22
          gentle question why must you disturb my rest will you give me no peace At All by night or day its tone was that of a kindly heart a grieved by injuries undeserved they looked up astonished but they had heard no sound of his coming and they saw a figure standing at the rail looking down upon them an old man SED in a great cloak the color of which was not easy to tell for it changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred his face was long with a high forehead he had deep darkling eyes hard to Fathom

          
          28:14:00
          though the look that they now bore was grave and benevolent and a little weary his hair and beard were white but but strands of black still showed about his lips and ears like and yet unlike muttered gim but come now said the soft voice two at least of you I know by name Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or counsel here but you Theoden Lord of The Mark of Rowan are declared by your Noble devices and still more by the fair countenance of the House of AOL oh worthy son of thle the

          
          28:14:39
          Thrice renowned why have you not come before and as a friend much have I desired to see you mightiest king of Western lands and especially in these latter years to save you from the unwise and evil councils that beset you is it yet too late despite the injuries that have been done to me in which the men of Rohan alas have had some part still I would save you and deliver you from the the ruin that draws nigh inevitably if you ride upon this road which you've taken indeed I alone can Aid you now theodan opened his mouth as if to

          
          28:15:19
          speak but he said nothing he looked up at the face of Saran with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him and then to Gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesitate Gandalf made no sign but stood silent a stone as one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet come the riters stirred at first murmuring with approval of the words of Salamon and then they too were silent as men Spellbound it seemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with theodan

          
          28:15:58
          and over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of a great danger the end of the mark in the darkness to which gandal was driving them while Sadam Stood Beside a door of Escape holding it half open so that a ray of light came through there was a heavy silence it was gimy the dwarf who broke it suddenly the words of this wizard stand on their heads he growled gripping the handle of his ax in the language of orun help means ruin and saving means slaying that is plain but we don't come here to beg peace said Salamon and for a fleeting

          
          28:16:41
          moment his voice was less Suave and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone I do not speak to you yet gimly gloin son he said far away as your home and small concern of yours are the Troubles of this land but it was not by design of your own that you became embroiled in them and so I will not blame such part as you have played a valiant one I doubt not but I pray you allow me first to speak with the king of Rohan my neighbor and once my friend what have you to say Theoden King will you have peace with me and all the

          
          28:17:20
          aid that my knowledge founded in long years can bring shall we make our counsels together against evil days and repair our injuries with such good will that our estate shall both come to fairer flower than ever before still theen did not answer whether he strove with anger or doubt none could say Amma spoke Lord hear me he said now we feel the Peril that we were warned of have we ridden forth to Victory only to stand at last Amazed by an old liar with honey on his forked tongue so would the trapped

          
          28:17:57
          wolf speak to the hounds if he could what Aid can he give to you for soth all he desires is to escape from his plight but will you parley with this deal in treachery and murder remember theod at the Fords and the grave of haror in Helms Deep if we speak of poisoned tongues what shall we say of yours young serpent said Salamon and the Flash of his anger was now plain to see but come am a son he went on in his soft voice again to every man his part Valor in arms is yours and you win high honor thereby slay whom your lord names his

          
          28:18:38
          enemies and be content meddle not in policies which you don't understand but maybe if you become a king you'll find that he must choose his friends with care the friends of Saron and the power of orun cannot be lightly thrown aside whatever grievances real or fancied may lie behind you've won a battle but not a war and that with help on which you cannot count again but you may find the shadow shadow of the wood at your own door next it is Wayward and senseless and has no love for men but my lord of Rowan am I to be

          
          28:19:18
          called a murderer because Valiant men have fallen in battle if you go to war needlessly for I didn't desire it then men will be slain but if I'm a murderer on that account then all the house of AOL is stained with murder for they've fought many wars and a Ked many who defi them yet with some they've afterwards made peace none the worse for being politic I say Theoden King shall we have peace and friendship you and I it is ours to command we will have peace said Theoden at last thickly and with an

          
          28:19:57
          effort several of the Riders Cried Out gladly Theoden held up his hand yes we will have peace he said now a clear voice we will have peace when you and all your Works have perished and the works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us you're a liar seran and a corruptor of men's Hearts you hold out your hand to me and I perceive only a finger of the claw of Mordor cruel and cold even if your war on me was just as it was not for were you 10 times as wise you had have no right to rule me and my

          
          28:20:37
          for your own profit as you desired even so what will you say of your torches in westfold and the children that lie dead there and they heed harmer's body before the gates of the hornberg after he was dead when you hang from a jibit at your window for the sport of your own crows I will have peace with you and orun so much for the house of AOL un less a son of great size am I but I don't need to lick your fingers tell else with her but I fear your voice has lost its charm the Riders gazed up at Theoden

          
          28:21:14
          like men startled out of a dream harsh as an old Ravens their master's voice sounded in their ears after the music of Saron but Saron for a while was beside himself with wroth he leaned over the rail as if he would Smite the king with a staff to assum suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike Chets and crows he hissed and they shuted at the Hideous change dotard what is the house of AOL but a thatched barn where brigin drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor among the dogs too long

          
          28:21:55
          have they escaped the jibit themselves but the Noose cabs slowly in the drawing tight and hard in the end hang if you will now his voice changed and he slow mastered himself I know not why I have had the patience to speak to you for I need you not nor your little band of gallopers as Swift to fly as to advance Theoden HSE Master long ago I offered you a state beyond your Merit and your wit I've offered it again so that Those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of Roads you give me brag and

          
          28:22:32
          abuse so be it go back to your huts by not you Gandalf for you at least I'm grieved feeling for your shame how comes it that you could endure such company for you proud Gandalf and not without reason having a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far even now will you not listen to my counsel gandal stirred and looked up what have you to say that you didn't say at our last meeting he asked or perhaps you have things to unsay Salamon paused unsay he mused as if puzzled unay I endeavored to advise you for your

          
          28:23:18
          own good but you scarcely listened you're proud and don't love advice having indeed a store of your own wisdom but on that occasion you heard I think misconstruing my intentions willfully I fear that in my eagerness to persuade you I lost patience and indeed I regret it for I bore you no ill will and even now I bear none though you return to me in the company of the violent and the ignorant how should I are we not both members of a high and Ancient Order most excellent in Middle Earth our friendship

          
          28:23:54
          would profit us both alike much we could still accomplish together to heal the disorders of the world let us understand one another and dismiss from thought these lesser Folk let them wait on our decisions for the common good I'm willing to redress the past and to receive you will you not consult with me will you not come up so great was the power that San exerted in this last effort that none that stood within hearing were unmoved but now the spell was wholly different they heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly King

          
          28:24:31
          with an earing but much loved Minister but they were shut out listening at a door to words not meant for them ill-mannered children or stupid servants overhearing The elusive discourse of their elders and wondering how it could affect their lot of lofty and mold these two were made Reverend and wise it was inevitable that they should make an alliance Gandalf would Ascend into the tower to discuss deep things beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of orun the door would be closed and they would be left outside dismissed to

          
          28:25:06
          await a lot work or punishment even in the mind of sodan the thought took shape like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he will go we shall be lost then Gandalf laughed the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke seron seron said gandal still laughing seron you missed your path in life you should have been the king's Jester and earned your bread and Stripes too by mimicking his counselors oh me he paused getting the better of his mirth understand one another I fear I'm beyond your comprehension but you camon

          
          28:25:47
          I understand now too well I keep a clearer memory of your arguments and deeds than you suppose when last I visited you you were the Jailer of Mordor and there I was to be sent nay the guest who has escaped from the roof will think twice before he comes back in by the door N I don't think I will come up but listen Salamon for the last time will you not come down Eis and God has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it so may other things in which you still have trust would it not be well to

          
          28:26:22
          leave it for a while to turn to a new thing perhaps think well camon will you not come down a shadow passed over San's face then it went deathly white before he could conceal it they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in doubt loathing to stay and dreading to leave its refuge for a second he hesitated and no one breathed then he spoke and his voice was shrill and cold pride and hate were conquering him will I come down he mocked does an unarmed men come down to speak with robbers Out of Doors I can

          
          28:26:59
          hear you well enough here I'm no fool and I don't trust you Gandalf they don't stand openly on my stairs but I know where the Wildwood demons are lurking at your command the treacherous or ever distrustful answered Gandalf wearily but you needn't fear for your skin I don't wish to kill you or hurt you as you would know if you really understood me and I have the power to protect you I'm giving you a last chance you can leave oron free if you choose that sounds will sneered saraban very much in the manner of gandal the

          
          28:27:35
          great so condescending and so very kind I don't doubt that you would find oron commodious and my departure convenient but why should I wish to leave and what do you mean by free there are conditions I presume reasons for leaving you can see from your windows answered Gandalf others will occur to your thought your servants are destroyed and Scattered your neighbors you have made your enemies and you have cheated your new master or tried to do so when his ey turns hither it will be the red eye of

          
          28:28:09
          WTH but when I say free I mean free free from Bond of chain or command to go where you will even even to Mordor Saron if you desire but you will first surrender to me the key of oron and your staff they shall be pledges of your conduct to be returned later if you Merit them San's face grew livid Twisted with rage and a red light was kindled in his eyes he laughed wildly later he cried and his voice Rose to a scream later yes when you also have the keys of bador itself I suppose and the crowns of seven Kings and the rods

          
          28:28:51
          of the five wizards and have purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes larger than those that you wear now a modest plan hardly one in which my help is needed I have other things to do don't be afraid fool if you wish to treat with me while you have a chance go away and come back when you're sober and Leave Behind These Cutthroats and small rag tag that tangle at your tail good day he turned and left the balcony come back Saron said Gandalf in a commanding voice to the amazement of the others

          
          28:29:29
          Salamon turned again and as if dragged against his will he came slowly back to the iron rail leaning on it Brea breathing hard his face was lined and shrunken his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw I didn't give you leave to go said gandaf sternly I have not finished you have become a fool seron and yet pitiable you might still have turned away from Folly and evil and have been of service but you choose to stay and know the ends of your old plots stay then but I warn you you won't easily

          
          28:30:04
          come out again not unless the dark hands of the East stretch out to take you seron he cried and his voice grew in power and authority behold I am not Gandalf the Gray whom you betrayed I am Gandalf the White who has returned from Death you have no color now and I cast you from the order and from the council he raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice seron your staff is broken there there was a crack and the staff split aunder in San's hand and the head of it fell down at Gandalf's feet go said Gandalf with a

          
          28:30:46
          cry Salamon fell back and crawled away at that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above it glanced off the iron rail even as San left it and passing close to Gandalf's head it smoked the stair on which he stood the rail rang and snapped the stair cracked and splintered in glittering Sparks but the ball was unharmed it rolled on down the steps a globe of Crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire as it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up the murderous

          
          28:31:18
          Rogue cried aama but Gandalf was unmoved no that was not thrown by seron he said nor even at his bidding I think it came from a window far above a parting shot from Master Worm tongue I fancy but ill- aimed the aim was poor maybe because he couldn't make up his mind which he hated more you seron said Aragon that may be so said Gandalf small Comfort will those two have in their companionship they will know one another with words but the punishment is just if worm Tong ever comes out of orun alive it will be more

          
          28:31:58
          than he deserves here my lad I'll take that I didn't ask you to handle it he cried turning sharply and seeing Pippen coming up the steps slowly as if he were bearing a great weight he went down to meet him and hastily took the dark Globe from The Hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak I'll take care of this he said it's not a thing I guess that San would have chosen to Cast Away but he may have other things to cast said gimy if that's the end of the debate let's go out of stone throw at least it is the

          
          28:32:34
          end said Gandalf let us go they turned their backs on the doors of orthon and went down the Riders hailed the king with joy and saluted Gandalf the spell of Salamon was broken they had seen him come at call and crawl away dismissed well that's done said Gandalf now I must find tree beard and tell him how things have gone he'll have guested surely said Mary were they likely to end any other way no not likely answered Gandalf though they came to the balance of a hair but I had reasons for trying some merciful and some less so first San

          
          28:33:17
          was shown that the power of his voice was waning he cannot be both Tyrant and counselor when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret yet he fell into the Trap and tried to deal with his victim's peace meal While others listened then I gave him a last choice and a fair one to rce both Mordor and his private schemes and make amends by helping us in our need he knows our need none better great service he could have rendered but he's chosen to withhold it and keep the power of oron he will not serve only

          
          28:33:53
          command he lives now in Terror of the Shadow of Mordor and yet he still dreams of Riding the Storm unhappy fool he'll be the B if the power of the East stretches out its arms to Eis andard we can't destroy orun from without but sain who knows what he can do and what if sain doesn't conquer what will you do to him asked Pippen I nothing said gandal I won't do anything to him I don't wish for Mastery what will become of him I can't say I grieved it so much that was good now Fest as in the tower still for us things have not

          
          28:34:36
          gone badly strange are the turns of Fortune often does hatred hurt itself I guess that even if we had entered in we could have found new Treasures in oron more precious than the thing which Worm tongue threw down at us a shill shriek suddenly cut off came from an open window high above it seems that seron thinks so too said Gandalf let's leave them they returned now out to the ruins of the gate hardly had they passed out under the arch when from under the shadows of the piled Stones where they had stood tree be and a dozen other ants

          
          28:35:16
          came striding up Aragorn gimly and legalis gazed at them in Wonder here are three of my companions Tre beard said Gandalf I've spoken of them but you haven't yet seen them he named them one by one the old an looked at them long and searchingly and spoke to them in turn last he came to legalis so you have come all the way from merkwood my good elf a very great Forest it used to be and still is said legalis but not so great that we who dwell there ever tired of seeing new trees I should dearly love to journey in

          
          28:35:55
          Fung gorn's wood I scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it and I didn't wish to turn back treebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure I hope you have your wish he the hills be much older he said I'll come if I have the fortune said legus I've made a bargain with my friend that if all goes well we'll visit fangor together by your leave any elf that comes with you will be welcome said tree beard the friend I speak of isn't an elf said legalis I mean gim glowing son here gimy bowed low and the axe slipped from

          
          28:36:34
          his belt and clattered on the ground H oh no said tree beard looking Dark Eyed at him a dwarf and an ex better I have good will to elves but you ask much this is a strange friendship strange it may seem said Legolas but while gimy lives I shall not come to fangorn alone his ax is not for trees but for orc necks o fangor master of Fung's wood 42 he hued in the battle oh come now said Treebeard that's a better story well well things will go as they will and there's no need to hurry to meet them but now we must part for a while

          
          28:37:21
          day is drawing to an end yet Gandalf says You must go a Nightfall and the lord of the Mark is eager for his own house yes we must go and go now said Gandalf I fear that I must take your gate keep us from you but you'll manage well enough without them maybe I shall said tree be but I shall miss them we've become friends in so short a while that I think I must be getting Hasty growing backwards towards youth perhaps but there they're the First new thing under sun or moon that I've seen for many a

          
          28:37:58
          long long day I sh forget them I put their names into the long list an will remember it an the earthborn old as mountains the wide Walkers water drinking and hungry as Hunters The Hobbit children The Laughing folk the little people they shall remain friends as long as leaves are nude Fair well but if you hear news up in your Pleasant land in the sh send me word you know what I mean word or sight of the an Wives come yourselves if you can we will said Mary and Pippen together and they turned away

          
          28:38:45
          hastily tree bear looked at them and was silent for a while shaking his head thoughtfully then he turned to Gandalf so Salamon would not leave he said I did not think he would his heart is as rotten as a black horns still if I would overcome and all my trees destroyed I would not come while I had one dark hole left to hide in no said Gandalf but you've not plotted to cover all the world with your trees and choke all other living things but there it is San remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he

          
          28:39:25
          can he has the key of orun but he must not be allowed to escape indeed no an will see to that said tree bir seron shall not sit foot Beyond The Rock without my leave in will watch over him good said Gandalf that is what I hoped now I can go and turn to other matters with one care the less but you must be wary the waters have gone down it will not be enough to put Sentinels around the tower I fear I don't doubt that there were deep ways delved under oron and that Salamon hopes to go and come unmarked before long if you will

          
          28:40:06
          undertake the labor I beg you to pour in the waters again and do so until e and guard remains a standing pool or you discover the outlets when all the underground places are drowned and the outlets blocked then San must stay upstairs and look out of the windows leave it to the ants said tree beard we shall search the Valley from head to foot and peer under every Pebble trees are coming back to live here old trees wild trees the watchwood we will call it not a squirrel will go here but I shall nve it leave it to in until

          
          28:40:45
          seven times the years in which he tormented us have passed we shall not tired of watching him chapter 11 the pantea the Sun was shining behind the long Western arm of the mountains when Gandalf and his companions and the king with his Riders set out again from Eisen guard Gandalf took Mary behind him and Aragon took Pippin two of the King's Men went on ahead riding swiftly and passed soon out of sight down into the valley the others followed at an easy Pace ANS in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate with their long arms

          
          28:41:34
          uplifted but they made no sound medy and Pippen looked back when they had passed someway down the winding road sunlight was still shining in the sky but Long Shadows reached over I and guard gray ruins Falling Into Darkness tree beards stood alone there now like the distant stump of an old tree the hobbits thought of their first meeting upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of fangorn they came to the pillar of the white hand the pillar was still standing but the Graven hand had been thrown down

          
          28:42:12
          and broken into small pieces right in the middle of the road the long foring gay white in the dusk its red nail darkening to Black the ants pay attention to every detail said Gandalf they rode on and evening deepened in the valley are we riding far tonight Gandalf asked Mary after a while I don't know how you feel with small rag tag dangling behind you but the rag tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down so you heard that said Gandalf don't let it wrinkle be thankful no longer words were aimed at you he had

          
          28:42:53
          his eyes on you if it is any comfort to your pride I should say that at the moment you and Pippen are more in his thoughts than all the rest of us who you are how you came there and and why what you know whether you were captured and if so how you escaped when all the Orcs perished it is with those little riddles that the great mind of San is troubled a sneer from him Mar aric is a compliment if you feel honored by his concern thank you said Mary but it's a greater honor to dangle at your tail Gandalf for one

          
          28:43:28
          thing in that position one has a chance of putting a question a second time are we riding far tonight gandaf laughed a most unquenchable Hobbit all wizards should have a hobbit or two in their car to teach them the meaning of the word and to correct them I beg your pardon but I have given thought even to these simple matters we will ride for a few hours gently until we come to the end of the Valley tomorrow we must ride faster when we came we meant to go straight from Eisen guard back to the King's

          
          28:44:02
          house at adus over the plains a ride of some days but we've taken thought and changed the plan Messengers have gone ahead to Helms Deep to warn them that the king is returning tomorrow he'll ride from there with many men to danh Haro by paths among the hills from now on no more than two or three together are to go openly over the land by day or night when it can be avoided nothing or a double helping is your way said Mary I'm afraid I wasn't looking Beyond tonight's bed where and what a hell deep and all the rest of it

          
          28:44:37
          I don't know anything about this country then you'd best learn something if you wish to understand what's happening but not just now and not for me I've too many pressing things to think about all right I'll tackle Strider by the campfire he's less testy but why all this secrecy I thought we'd won the battle yes we've won but only the first Victory and that in itself increases our danger there was some link between I andard and Mordor which I've not yet fathomed how they exchanged news I'm not sure but they did so the eye of

          
          28:45:15
          bador will be looking impatiently towards the wizard Veil I think and towards Rohan the less it sees the better the road passed slowly winding down the Valley now further and now nearer ice and flowed in its Stony bed night came down from the mountains all the Mists were gone a chill wind blew the moon now waxing round filled the Eastern sky with a pale cold Sheen the shoulders of the mountain to their right sloped down to Bare Hills the wide Plains opened gray before them at last they halted then they turned aside leaving

          
          28:45:59
          the highway and taking to the Sweet Upland Turf again going Westward a mile or so they came to a Dale it opened Southward leaning back into the slope of round DOL Baran the last Hill of the northern Rangers greenf footed crowned with Heather the sides of the Glenn were Shaggy with last year's Bracken among which the tight curled fronds of spring were just thrusting through the sweet centered Earth Thorn bushes grew thick upon the low Banks and under them they made their Camp two hours or so before the middle

          
          28:46:34
          of the night they lit a fire in a hollow down among the roots of a spreading Hawthorne tall as a tree ryen with age but hail in every limb BDS were swelling at each Twig's tip guards were set two to watch the rest after they had spped wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept The Hobbit lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old Bracken Mary was sleepy but Pippen now seemed curiously Restless the Bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted and turned what's the matter asked Mary are you

          
          28:47:12
          lying on an antill no said Pippen but I'm not comfortable I wonder how long it is since I slept in a bed Mary yawned work it out on your fingers he said but you must know how long it is since we left lauan oh that said Pippen I mean a real bed in a bedroom well rivendel then said Mary but I could sleep anywhere tonight you had the luck Mary said Pippen softly after a long pause you were riding with Gandalf well what of it did you get any news any information out of him yes a good deal more than usual

          
          28:47:55
          but you heard it all or most of it you were close by and we were talking no secrets but you can go with him tomorrow if you think you'll get more out of him and if he have you can I good but he's close isn't he not changed at all oh yes he is said Mary waking up a little and beginning to wonder what was bothering His companion he has grown or something he can be both Kinder and more alarming merrier and more solemn than before I think he's changed but we've not had a chance to see him much yet but think of

          
          28:48:30
          the last part of that business with Saron remember Saron was once Gandalf Superior head of the council whatever that may be exactly he was San the white Gandalf is the white now Salamon came when he was told and his Rod was taken and then he was just told to go and he went well if gandal has changed at all then he's closer than ever that's all Pippen argued that glass ball now he seemed Mighty pleased with it he knows or guesses something about it but does he tell us what no not a word yet I picked it up and I saved it from rolling

          
          28:49:12
          into a pool here I'll take that my lad that's all I wonder what it is it felt so very heavy Pippen's voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself hello said Mary so that's what is bothering you now pipp and my lad don't forget gildor saying the one Sam used to qu do not meddle in the Affairs of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger but our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the Affairs of wizards said Pippen I should like a bit of information as well as danger I

          
          28:49:50
          should like a look at that ball go to sleep said Mary you'll get information enough sooner or later my dear Pippen no toque ever beat a brandy Buck for inquisitiveness but is this the time I ask you all right what's the harm in my telling you what I should like a look at that stone I know I can't have it with old gandal sitting on it like a hen on an egg but it doesn't help much to get no more from you than a you can't have it so go to sleep well what else could I say said Mary I'm sorry Pippen but you really

          
          28:50:28
          must wait till the morning I'll be as curious as you like after breakfast and I'll help in any way I can at wizard weedling but I can't keep awake any longer if I yawn anymore I shall split at the ears good night Pippen said no more he lay still now but sleep remained far away and it was not encouraged by the sound of Mary breathing softly asleep in a few minutes after saying good night the thought of the dark Globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet Pippen felt again its weight in his hands and saw again the

          
          28:51:06
          mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment he tossed and turned and tried to think of something else at last he could stand it no longer he got up and looked round it was chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him the moon was shining cold and white down into the dell and the Shadows of the bushes were black all about lay sleeping shapes the two gods were not in view they were up on the hill perhaps or hidden in the Bracken driven by some impulse that he did not understand Pippen walked softly to where Gandalf

          
          28:51:42
          lay he looked down at him the wizard seemed asleep but with lids not fully closed there was a glitter of Eyes under his long lashes Pippin stepped back hastily but Gandalf made no sign and drawn forward once more half against his will The Hobbit crept up again from behind the Wizard's head he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread over the top and close beside him between his right side and his bent arm there was a Hummock something round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only just to

          
          28:52:18
          have slipped off It To The Ground hardly breathing Pippen crept nearer foot by foot at last he knelt down then he put his hands out stealthily and slowly lifted the lump up it didn't seem quite so heavy as he had expected only some bundle of oddments perhaps after all he thought with a strange sense of relief but he didn't put the bundle down again he stood for a moment clasping it then an idea came into his mind he tiptoed away found a large Stone and came back quickly now he drew off the cloth

          
          28:52:57
          wrapped the stone in it and kneeling down laid it back by the Wizard's hand then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered there it was a smooth globe of Crystal now dark and dead lying bare before his knees Pippen lifted it covered it hurriedly in his own cloak and half turned to go back to his bed at that moment Gandalf moved in his sleep and muttered some words they seemed to be in a strange tongue his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped Stone then he sighed and did not move again

          
          28:53:36
          you idiotic fool Pippen muttered to himself you're going to get yourself into frightful trouble put it back quick but he found now that his knees quaked and he didn't dare to go near enough to the wizard to reach the bundle I'll never get it back now without waking him he thought not till I'm a bit calmer so I may as well have a look first not just here though he stole away and sat down on a green hillock not far from his bed the Moon looked in over the edge of the Dell Pippen sat with his knees drawn up

          
          28:54:10
          and the ball between them he bent low over it looking like a greedy child stooped over a bowl of food in a corner away from others he drew his cloak aside and gazed at it the air seemed still and tense about him at first the globe was dark black as jet with a Moonlight gleaming on its surface then there came a faint glow and stir in the heart of it and it held his eyes so that now he could not look away soon all the inside seemed on far the ball was spinning or the lights within were revolving suddenly the lights went

          
          28:54:48
          out he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent clasping the ball with both hands closer and closer he bent and then became rigid his lips moved soundlessly for a while then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still the cry was piercing the guards leapt down from the banks all the camp was soon a stir so this is a thief said Gandalf hastily he cast his cloak over the globe where it lay but you Pippin this is a grievous turn to things he knelt by Pippen's body The Hobbit was lying on

          
          28:55:25
          his back rigid with unseen eyes staring up at the sky the devilry what Mischief has he done to himself and to all of us the Wizard's face was drawn and Haggard he took Pippen's hand and bent over his face listening for his breath then he laid his hands on his brow The Hobbit shuddered his eyes closed he cried out and sat up staring in bewilderment at all the faces around him pale in the Moonlight it's not for you Saron he cried in a shrill and toneless voice shrinking away from Gandalf I will send for it at once do

          
          28:56:01
          you understand say just that then he struggled to get up and Escape but Gandalf held him gently and firmly Perrin took he said come back The Hobbit relaxed and fell back clinging to the Wizard's hand Gandalf he cried Gandalf forgive me forgive you said the wizard tell me first what you've done I I took the ball and looked at it stammered Pippin and I saw things that frightened me and I wanted to go away but I couldn't and then he came came and questioned me and he looked at me and and that is all I remember that won't do

          
          28:56:40
          said Gandalf sternly what did you see and what did you say Pippen shut his eyes and shivered but said nothing they all stared at him in silence except Mary who turned away but Gandalf's face was still hard speak he said in a low hesitating voice Pippen began again and slowly his words grew clearer and stronger I saw dark sky and tall battlements he said and tiny stars it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear then the Stars went in and out they were cut off by things with wings very big I think really but in the

          
          28:57:20
          glass they looked like bats Wheeling around the tower I thought there were nine of them one began to fly straight towards me getting bigger and bigger it had a horrible no no I can't say I tried to get away because I thought it would fly out but when it had covered all the globe it disappeared then he came he didn't speak so that I could hear words he just looked and I understood so you have come back why have you neglected to report for so long I didn't answer he said who are you I still didn't answer but it hurt me

          
          28:58:00
          horribly and he pressed me so I said a Hobbit then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me it was cruel it was like being stabbed with knives I struggled but he said wait a moment we shall meet again soon tell Saron that this dainty is not for him I will send for it at once do you understand say just that then he gloated over me I felt I was falling to pieces no no I can't say anymore I don't remember anything else look at me said Gandalf Pippin looked up straight into his eyes the wizard held his gaze for a

          
          28:58:40
          moment in silence then his face grew gentler and the shadow of a smile appeared he laid his hand Softly on Pippen's head all right he said say no more you've taken no harm there's no lie in your eyes as I feared but he didn't speak along with you a fool but an honest man you remain pedig toque wiser ones might have done worse in such a pass but Mark this you've been saved and all your friends too mainly by Good Fortune as it's called you can't count on it a second time if he'd questioned you then and

          
          28:59:19
          there almost certainly you would have told all that you know to the ruin of us all but he was too eager he didn't want information only he wanted you quickly so that he could deal with you in the Dark Tower slowly don't shudder if you will meddle in the Affairs of wizards you must be prepared to think of such things but come I forgive you be comforted things have not turned out as evily as they might he lifted Pippen gently and carried him back to his bed medy followed and sat beside him lie there and rest if you can Pippen said

          
          28:59:57
          Gandalf trust me if you feel an itch in your palms again tell me of it such things can be cured but anyway my dear Hobbit don't put a lump of rock under my elbow again now I'll leave you two together for a while with that Gandalf returned to the others who were still standing by the orun stone in troubled thought barel comes in the night when least expected he said we've had a narrow Escape how is The Hobbit Pippen asked Aragorn I think all will be well now answered Gandalf he was not held long

          
          29:00:33
          and which have an amazing power of recovery the memory or the horror of it will probably fade quickly too quickly perhaps will you Aragon take the orun stone and guard it it's a dangerous charge dangerous indeed but not to all said arod there's one who may claim it by right for this assuredly is the Palante of all Thon from the treasury of alil said here by the kings of Gondor now my AR was near I will take it Gandalf looked at Aragorn and then to the surprise of the others he lifted the covered Stone and bowed as he presented

          
          29:01:14
          it receive it Lord he said in Earnest of other things that shall be given back but if I may counsel you in the use of your own don't use it yet be wary when have I been Hasty or unwar who have waited and prepared for so many years asked Aragon never yet don't then stumble at the end of the road answered Gandalf but at the least keep this thing secret you and all others that stand here The Hobbit pedig above all should not know where it is bestowed the evil fit may come on him again for alas he's

          
          29:01:53
          handled it and looked in it that should never have happened he ought never to have touched it in I andard and there I should have been quicker but my mind was bent on Salamon and I didn't at once guess the nature of the stone then I was weary and as I lay pondering it sleep overcame me now I know yes there can be no doubt said Aragon at last we know the link between eard and Mordor and how it worked much is explained strange Powers have our enemies and strange weaknesses said theodon but it is long been said of evil

          
          29:02:31
          will shall evil Mar that many times is seen said Gandalf but at this time we have been strangely fortunate maybe I've been saved by this Hobbit from a grave blunder I'd considered whether or not to probe this Stone myself to find its uses had I done so I should have been revealed to him myself I'm not ready for such a trial if indeed I shall ever be so but even if I found the power to withdraw myself it would be disastrous for him to see me yet until the hour comes when secrecy will Avail no longer that hour is now come I think

          
          29:03:08
          said Aragon not yet said Gandalf there remains a short while of Doubt which we must use the enemy it is clear thought that the stone was in orun why should he not and that therefore The Hobbit was captive there driven to look in the glass for his torment by Salamon that dark mind will be filled now with the voice and face of The Hobbit and with expectation it may take some time before he learns his better we must snatch that time we've been too leisurely we must move the neighborhood of Eisen guard is

          
          29:03:41
          no place to linger in I will ride ahead at once with perigrine to it will be better for him than lying in the dark While others sleep I will keep armor and 10 Riders said the king they shall ride with me at early day the rest may go with Aragorn and ride as soon as they have a mind as you will said Gandalf but make all the speed you made to the cover of the hills to Helm's Deep at that moment a shadow fell over them the bright Moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off several of the Riders cried out and crouched holding their

          
          29:04:17
          arms above their heads as if to W off a blow from above a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them cowering they looked up a vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud it wheeled and went North flying at a speed greater than any wind of Middle Earth the Stars fainted before it it was gone they stood up rigid as Stones Gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downwards stiff his hands clenched NZ he cried the messenger of Mordor the storm is coming the nasal have crossed the river ride ride wait not for the dawn

          
          29:04:59
          let not the Swift wait for the slow ride he sprang away calling shadow f as he ran Aragon followed him going to Pippen gandal picked him up in his arms you shall come with me this time he said shadowax shall show you his Paces then he ran to the place where he had slept shadowax stood there ready slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horse's back Aragorn lifted Pippen and set him in Gandalf's arms wrapped in Cloak and blanket farewell follow fast cried Gandalf away shadowax

          
          29:05:34
          the great horse tossed his head his flowing tail flicked in the Moonlight then he leapt forward spurning the Earth and was gone like The North Wind from the mountains a beautiful restful night said Mary to Aragorn some folk have wonderful luck he didn't want to sleep and he wanted to ride with Gandalf and there he goes instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand here forever as a warning if you had been the first to lift the orthon stone and not e how would it be now said Aragorn you might have done worse who can say but

          
          29:06:09
          now it's your luck to come with me I fear at once go and get ready and bring anything that Pippen Left Behind make haste over the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging and no guidance less than an hour had passed and they had reached the Fords of eon and crossed them the mound of the Riders and its cold Spears lay gray behind them Pippen was recovering he was warm but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing he was with Gandalf the horror of the stone and of the Hideous Shadow over the moon

          
          29:06:44
          was fading things left behind in the midsts of the mountains or in a passing dream he drew a deep breath I didn't know you rode bear back Gandalf he said you haven't a saddle or a bridal I don't ride elf fashion except on shadowax said Gandalf but shadowax will have no harness you don't ride shadowx he's willing to carry you or not if he's willing that's enough it's then his business to see that you remain on his back unless you jump off into the air how fast is he going asked Pippen fast by the wind but very smooth and how

          
          29:07:23
          light his footfalls are he's running now as fast as the swiftest horse could Gallop answered Gandalf but that is not fast for him the land is rising a little here and is more broken than it was beyond the river but see how the White Mountains are drawing near Under the Stars Yonder are the three he and Peaks like black Spears it will not be long before we reach the branching roads and come to the Deep Inc where the battle was fought two nights ago Pippin was silent again for a while he heard gandal singing softly to

          
          29:07:57
          himself murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran under them at last the wizard passed into a song of which The Hobbit caught the words a few lines came clearly to his ears through the rushing of the wind tall ships and Tall Kings three * three what brought they from the founded land over the flowing sea Seven Stars and seven stones and one white tree what are you saying Gandalf asked Pippen I was just running over some of the rhymes of lore in my mind answered the wizard Hobbits I suppose have

          
          29:08:39
          forgotten them even those that they have a new no not all said Pippen and we have many of our own which wouldn't interest you perhaps but I've never heard this one what is it about the Seven Stars and seven stones about the panary of the kings of old said Gandalf what are they the name meant that which looks far away Boron Stone was one then it was not made not made Pippen hesitated by the Enemy No said Gandalf nor by seron it's beyond his art and Beyond saurin too the Panter Came From Beyond westernness from

          
          29:09:25
          Emar the ndor made them fanor himself maybe wrought them in days so long ago that the time cannot be measured in years but there's nothing that saon cannot turn to evil uses alas for seron it was his downfall as I now perceive perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves yet he must bear the Blame Fool to keep it secret for his own profit no word did he ever speak of it to any of the council we hadn't yet given thought to the fate of the palant are of Gondor in its ruin its Wars by

          
          29:10:05
          men they were almost forgotten even in Gondor they were a secret known only to a few in aror they were remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the dunad what did the men of old use them for asked Pippen delighted and astonished at getting answers to so many questions and wondering how long it would last to see far off and to Converse in thought with one another said Gandalf in that way they long guarded and United the realm of Gondor they set up stones at minano and at minil and at oron in the ring of

          
          29:10:42
          isard the chief and master of these was Under the Dome of stars of os gillath before its ruin the three others were far away in the North in the house of Eland it's told that they were at annuminas and ammonul and lendel stone was on the tower Hills that look towards mithlond in the Gulf of Lon where the Great ships lie each Palante here applies to each but all those in Gondor were ever open to the view of O gillath now it appears that as the rock of oron has withstood the storms of time so there the paner of

          
          29:11:19
          that tower has remained but alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far off and days remote very useful no doubt that was to seron yet it seems that he was not content further and further abroad he gazed until he cast his gaze upon bador then he was caught who knows where the Lost stones of aror and Gondor now lie bed or drowned deep but one at least sa must have obtained and mastered to his purposes I guess it was the ithil stone for he took minil long ago and turned it into an evil Place Min morle it has

          
          29:12:01
          become easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of Salamon was trapped and held and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar and daunted when persuasion would not serve the bite a bit the hawk under the Eagle's foot the spider in a steel web how long I Wonder has he been constrained to come off into his glass for inspection and instruction of the orun stone so bent towards barad door that if any save a will of adamant now looks into it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither and how it draws one to itself

          
          29:12:39
          have I not felt it even now my heart desires to test my will upon it to see if I could not wrench it from him and turn it where I would to look across the wide Seas of water and of time to te on the fair and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of fanor at their work while both the white tree and the golden were in flow he sighed and fell silent I wish I'd known all this before said Pippen I had no notion of what I was doing oh yes you had said Gandalf you knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly and you told yourself so

          
          29:13:17
          though you didn't listen I didn't tell you all this before because it's only by musing on all that has happened that I've at last understood even as we ride together but if I'd spoken sooner it wouldn't have lessened your desire or made it easier iier to resist on the contrary know the burned hand that teaches best after that advice about fire goes to the heart it does said Pippen if all the seven stones were laid out before me now I should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets good said Gandalf that is what I hoped but I

          
          29:13:55
          should like to know Pippen began Mercy cried Gandalf if the giving of information is to be the Cure of your inquisit I shall spend all the rest of my days in answering you what more do you want to know the names of all the stars and of all living things and the whole history of Middle Earth and over heaven and of the sing Seas laughed Pippen of course what less but I'm not in a hurry tonight at the moment I was just wondering about the black shadow I heard you shout messenger of Mordor what was it what

          
          29:14:30
          could it do at eard it was a a Black Rider on wings a Nazgul said Gandalf it could have taken you away to The Dark Tower but it wasn't coming from me was it faltered Pippen I mean it didn't know that I had of course not said Gandalf it is 200 Leagues or more in straight flight from barad door to oron and even a Nazgul would take a few hours to fly between them but San certainly looked in the stone since the orc raade and more of his seet thought I do not doubt has been read than he intended a messenger

          
          29:15:08
          has been sent to find out what he's doing and after what has happened tonight another will come I think and swiftly so San will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put his hand in he has no captive to send he has no stone to see with and cannot answer the summons sarin will only believe that he is withholding the captive and refusing to use the stone it will not help seron to tell the truth to the messenger for Renard may be ruined yet he is still safe in oron so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel yet he

          
          29:15:45
          rejected us so as to avoid that very thing what he will do in such a plight I cannot guess he has power still I think while in Ork to resist the nine Riders he may try to do so he may try to trap the nasgul or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air in that case let Rohan look to its horses but I can't tell how it will fall out well or ill for us it may be that the counsels of the enemy will be confused or hindered by his wroth with Salamon it may be that he will learn that I was

          
          29:16:22
          there and stood upon the stairs of orun with Hobbits at my tail all that an air of elendil lives and Stood Beside Me If Worm tongue was not deceived by the armor of Rohan he would remember Aragorn and the title that he claimed that is what I fear and so we fly not from danger but into greater danger every stride of shadowfax bears you nearer to the land of Shadow perigrine to Pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak as if a sudden chill had struck him gray land passed under them see now said

          
          29:16:58
          Gandalf the West fold Dales are opening before us here we come back to the Eastward Road the dark shadow Yonder is the mouth of the deep pom that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves don't ask me about them ask gimly if you meet again and for the first time you may get an answer longer than you wish you will not see the caves yourself not on this journey soon they will be far behind I thought you were going to stop at Helms Deep said Pippen where are you going then to minister before the Seas of War surround it oh

          
          29:17:36
          and how far is that leagues upon leagues answered Gandalf Thrice as far as the dwellings of King Theoden and they more than 100 miles east from here as The Messengers of Mordor fly shadowx must run a longer road which will prove the swifter we shall ride now till Daybreak and that is some hours away then even shadowfax must rest in some Hollow of the Hills at Eder us I hope sleep if you can you may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden roof of the House of AOL and in two days then you shall

          29:18:54
          running horse while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind book four chapter 1 The Taming of smeagle well master we're in a fixing no mistake said Sam gamji he stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside Frodo and peered out with Pucket eyes into the Gloom it was the third evening since they' fled from the company as far as they could tell they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had climbed and labored among the barren slopes and stones of the EM

          
          29:19:41
          mu sometimes retracing their steps because they could find No Way Forward sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had been hours before yet on the whole they had worked steadily Eastward keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this strange Twisted knot of hills but always they found its outward faces sheer high and impossible frowning over the plain below Beyond its tumble skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even a bird was to

          
          29:20:16
          be seen the Hobbit stood now on the brink of a tall Cliff bare and Bleak its feet wrapped in mist and behind them Rose the broken Highlands crowned with drifting Cloud a chill wind blew from the East night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them the sickly green of them was fading to a sullen Brown far away to the right the andwin that had gleamed fitfully in Sun breakes during the day was Now hidden in Shadow but their eyes didn't look beyond the river back to Gondor to their friends to

          
          29:20:54
          the lands of men south and east day stad to where at the edge of the oncoming night a dark line hung like distant mountains of motionless smoke every now and again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of Earth and Sky what a fix said Sam that's the one place in all the lands we've ever heard of that we don't want to see any closer and that's the one place we're trying to get to and that's just where we can't get noow we've come the wrong way altogether seemingly we can't get down

          
          29:21:34
          and if we get down we'll find all that green land a nasty bug I'll warrant phw can you smell it he sniffed at the wind yes I can smell it said Frodo but he didn't move and his eyes remained fixed staring out towards the dark line and the flickering flame more door he muttered under his breath if I must go there I wish I could come there quickly and make an end he shuddered the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odor of cold Decay well he said at last withdrawing his eyes we can't stay here all night fix or no fix

          
          29:22:17
          we must find a more sheltered spot and Camp once more and perhaps another day will show us a path or another and another and another muted Sam or maybe no day we've come the wrong way I wonder said Frodo it's my Doom I think to go to that shadow Yonder so that a way will be found but will good or evil show it to me what hope we had was in Speed delay plays into the enemy's hands and here I am delayed is it the will of The Dark Tower that steers us all my choices have proved ill I should have left the company long

          
          29:22:58
          before and come down from the north east of the river and of the Emin mu and so over the hard of battle plane to the passes of Mordor but now it is impossible for you and me alone to find a way back and the Orcs are prowling on the East Bank every day that passes is a precious day lost I'm tired Sam I don't know what's to be done what food have we got left only those what you call them lmas Mr Frodo a fair Supply but they're better than not by a long bite I never thought though when I first set tooth in

          
          29:23:35
          them that I should ever come to wish for a change but I do now a bit of plain bread and mug I half a mug of beer would go down proper I've lugged my cooking gear all the way from the last camp and what use has it been not to make a fire with for a start and not to cook not even grass they turned away and went down into a Stony Hollow the westering sun was caught into clouds and night came swiftly they slept as well as they could for the cold turn and turn about in a Nook among great Jagged Pinnacles of

          
          29:24:12
          weathered rock at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind did you see them again Mr Frodo asked Sam as they sat stiff and chilled munching Wafers of lmas in the cold gray of early morning no said Frodo I've heard nothing and seen nothing for two nights now nor me said Sam girl Those Eyes did give me a turn but perhaps we've shaken him off at last the miserable slinker Gollum I'll give him Gollum in his throat If Ever I get my hands on his neck I hope you'll never need to said Frodo I don't know how he followed us

          
          29:24:57
          but it may be that he's lost us again as you say in this dry Bleak land with can't leave many Footprints nor much scent even for his snuffling nose I hope that's the way of it said Sam I wish we could be rid of him for good so do I said Frodo but is not my chief trouble I wish we could get away from these Hills I hate them I feel all naked on the east side stuck up here with nothing but the dead Flats between me and that shadow Yonder there's an eye in it come on we've got to get down today somehow

          
          29:25:35
          but that day wore on and when afternoon faded towards evening they were still scrambling along the Ridge and had found no way of Escape sometimes in the Silence of that Barren country they fancied that they heard faint sounds behind them a stone falling or the imagined step of flapping feet on the Rock but if they halted and stood still listening they heard no more nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the Stone yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp teeth all that day the outer rides of

          
          29:26:10
          the EM mu had been bending gradually northward as they struggled on along its Brink there now stretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock cut every now and again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in The Cliff face to find a path in these Cliffs which were becoming deeper and more frequent Frodo and Sam were driven to their left well away from the edge and they didn't notice that for several miles they'd been going slowly but steadily downhill the cliff toop was

          
          29:26:43
          sinking towards the level of the lowlands at last they were brought to a halt the ridge took a sharper Bend northward and was gashed by a deeper Ravine on the further side it reared up again many fathoms at a single deap a Great Gray Cliff loomed before them cut sheared down as if by a knife stroke they could go no further forwards and must turn now either west or east but West would lead them only into more labor and delay back towards the hearts of the Hills East would take them to the outer precipice there's nothing for it but to

          
          29:27:20
          scramble down this Gully Sam said Frodo let's see what it leads to a nasty drop I'll bet said Sam the cliff was longer and deeper than it seemed some way down they found a few nared and stunted trees the first they had seen for days Twisted Birch for the most part with here and there a fur tree many were dead and gaunt bitten to the core by the Eastern winds once in milder days there must have been a fair Thicket in the Ravine but now after some 50 yards the trees came to an end though old broken stumps straggled on almost to

          
          29:28:00
          the Cliff's Brink the the bottom of the galley which lay along the edge of a rock F was rough with broken Stone and slanted steeply down when they came at last to the end of it Frodo stooped and leaned out look he said we must have come down a long way or else the cliff is sunk It's much lower here than it was and it looks easier too Sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge then he glanced up at the great Cliff rising up away on the left easier he grunted well I suppose it's always

          
          29:28:37
          easier getting down than up those as can't fly can jump it would be a big jump still said Frodo about well he stood for a moment measuring it with his eyes about 18 fathoms I should guess not more and that's enough said Sam ah how I do hate looking down from a height but looking better than climbing all the same said Frodo I think we could climb here and I think we shall have to try see the rock is quite different from what it was a few miles back it has slipped and cracked the outer fall was indeed no

          
          29:29:18
          longer sheer but sloped outwards a little it looked like a great ramper or seaw wall whose foundations had shifted so that its courses were all twisted and disordered leaving great fishes and long slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as stairs and if we're going to try and get down we'd better try it once it's getting dark early I think there's a storm coming the Smoky blur of the mountains in the East was lost in a deeper Blackness that was already reaching out Westward with long arms there was a distant mutter of

          
          29:29:55
          Thunder borne on the rising Breeze Frodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky he strapped his belt out outside his cloak and tightened it and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge I'm going to try it he said very good said Sam gloomily but I'm going first you said Frodo what's made you change your mind about climbing I haven't changed my mind but it's only since put the one lowest as is most likely to slip I don't want to come down a top of you and knock you off no sense

          
          29:30:31
          in killing two with one fall before Frodo could stop him he sat down swung his legs over the brink and twisted round scrabbling with his toes for a foothold it is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in Cold Blood or more unwise no no Sam you old ass said Frodo you'll kill yourself for certain going over like that without even a look to see what to make for come back he took Sam under the arm trumpets and H him up again now wait a bit and be patient he said then he lay on the ground leaning out and looking down but the light

          
          29:31:11
          seemed to be fading quickly although the sun had not yet set I think we can manage this he said presently I could at any rate and you could too if you kept your head and followed me carefully I don't know how you can be so sure said Sam why you can't see to the bottom in this light what if if he comes to a place where there's nowhere to put your feet or your hands climb back I suppose said Frodo EAS he said objected Sam better wait till morning and more light no not if I can help it said Frodo with a sudden strange vment I Grudge

          
          29:31:50
          every hour every minute I'm going down to try it out don't you follow till I come back or call ripping the Stony lip of the Fall with his fingers he let himself gently down until when his arms were almost at full stretch his toes found a ledge one step down he said and this ledge broadens out to the right I could stand there without a hold I'll his words were cut short the hurrying Darkness now Gathering great speed rushed up from the East and swallowed the sky there was a dry splitting crack of

          
          29:32:29
          thunder right overhead searing like sing smot down into the hills then came a blast of savage wind and with it mingling with its Roar there came a high shrill shriek the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the Mish as they fled from hobbiton and even there in the woods of the Sha it had Frozen their blood out here in the waist its Terror was far greater it pierced them with cold Blades of horror and despair stopping heart and breath Sam fell flat on his face involuntarily Frodo loosed

          
          29:33:05
          his hold and put his hands over his head and ears he swayed slipped and slithered downwards with a wailing cry Sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge master master he called Master he heard no answer he found he was shaking all over but he gathered his breath and once again he shouted Master the wind seemed to blow his voice back into his throat but as it passed roaring up the galy and Away over the hills a faint answering Cry came to his ears all right all right I'm here but I can't

          
          29:33:46
          see Frodo was calling with a weak voice he wasn't actually very far away he'd slid and not fallen and had come up with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge not many yards lower down fortunately the rock face at this point leaned well fell back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff so that he hadn't toppled over he steadied himself a little laying his face against the coold stone feeling his heart pounding but either the darkness had grown complete or else his eyes had lost their sight all was black about him he wondered if

          
          29:34:22
          he'd been struck blind he took a deep breath come back come back he heard Sam's voice out of the Blackness above I can't he said I can't see I can't find any hold I can't move yet what can I do Mr Frodo what can I do shouted Sam leaning out dangerously far why couldn't his master see it was dim certainly but not as dark as all that he could see Frodo below him a gray foror figure spayed against the cliff but he was far out of the reach of any helping hand there was another crack of thunder and then the rain came in a blinding

          
          29:35:06
          sheet mingled with hail it drove against the cliff bitter cold I'm coming down to you shouted Sam though how he hoped to help in that way he could not have said no no wait Frodo called back more strongly now I shall be better soon I feel better already wait you can't do anything without a rope rope cried Sam talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief well if I don't deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning to num skulls you're not but a nin Hammer Sam gamji that's what the gaffer said to

          
          29:35:50
          me often enough it being a word of his rope stop chattering cried Frodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed never mind your gaffer are you trying to tell yourself you've got some rope in your pocket if so out with it yes Mr Frodo in my pack and all carried at hundreds of miles and i' clean forgotten it then get busy and let an end down quickly Sam unslung his pack and raged in it there indeed at the bottom was a coil of the silk and gray rope made by the folk of lauran he cast an

          
          29:36:25
          end to his master the darkness seemed to lift from Frodo's eyes or else his sight was returning he could see the Gray Line as it came dangling down and he thought it had a faint silver sheen now that he had some point in the darkness to fix his eyes on he felt less giddy leaning his weight forward he made the end fast to his waist and then he grasped the line with both hands Sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from The Edge half HED half scrambling Frodo came up and threw himself on the

          
          29:37:00
          ground Thunder grow and rumbled in the distance and the rain was still falling heavily the hobbits crawled away back into the galy but they didn't find much shelter there reals of water began to run down soon they grew to a Spate that splashed and fumed on the stones and spouted out over the hill like the gutters of a vast roof I should have been half drowned down there or washed clean off said Frodo what a piece of luck you had that rope better luck if I thought of it sooner said Sam maybe you remember them

          
          29:37:35
          putting the ropes in the boats as we started off in the Elish country I took a fancy to it and I stoed a coil in my pack years ago it seems it may be a help in many needs he said Hower or one of those folk and he spoke right A pity I didn't think of bringing another length said Frodo but I left the company in such a hurry and confusion if only we' enough we could use it to get down how long's your rope I wonder Sam pain it out slowly measuring it with his arms 5 10 20 30 L's more or less he said who

          
          29:38:17
          would have thought it Frodo exclaimed ah who would said Sam elves are wonderful folk it looks a bit thin but it's tough and soft as milk to the hand packs close too and as light as light wonderful folk to be sure 30 L's said Frodo considering I believe it would be enough if the storm passes before nightfall I'm going to try it the rain's nearly given over already said Sam but don't you go doing anything risky in the dim again Mr Frodo and I haven't got over that shriek on the Wind yet if you have like a Black Rider it

          
          29:38:57
          sounded but one up in the air if they can fly I'm thinking we best lay up in this crackle night's over and I'm thinking that I won't spend a moment longer than I need stuck up on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking over the marshes said Frodo with that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the galy again he looked out clear sky was growing in the East once more the skirts of the storm were lifting ragged and wet and the main battle had passed to spread its great Wings Over the am in oil upon which the

          
          29:39:33
          dark thought of saurin brooded for a while then it turned smiting the veil of andwin with hail and lightning and casting it Shadow upon Min tyth with threat of War then lowering in the mountains and Gathering its great spares it rolled on slowly over Gondor and the skirts of Rohan until far away the Riders on the plane saw its black Towers moving behind the Sun as they rode into the West but here over the desert and the wreaking marshes the deep blue sky of evening opened once more and a few pet

          
          29:40:11
          Stars appeared like small white holes in the canopy above the Crescent Moon it's good to be able to see again said Frodo breathing deep do you know I thought for a bit that I lost my sight from the lightning or something else worse I could see nothing nothing at all until the rope came down it seemed to Shimmer somehow it does look sort of silverin the-dark said Sam never noticed it before though I can't remember as I've ever had it out since I first stowed it but if you're so set on climbing Mr

          
          29:40:47
          Frodo how are you going to use it 30 L's or say about 18 fathom that's no more than your guess at the height of the cliff Frodo thought for a while make it fast to that stump Sam he said then I think you shall have your wish this time and go first I'll lower it and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock though if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give me a rest it'll help when you're down I'll follow I feel quite myself again now very well said Sam heavily if it

          
          29:41:28
          must be let's get it over he took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink then the other end he tied about his own waist reluctantly had turned and prepared to go over the edge a second time it did not however turn out half as bad as he had expected the Rope seemed to give him confidence though he shut his eyes more than once when he looked down between his feet there was one awkward spot where there was no Ledge in the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space there he slipped and swung out on

          
          29:42:06
          the silver line but Frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was over at last his chief fear had been that the Rope length would give out while he was still high up but there was still a good bite in Frodo's hands when Sam came to the bottom and called up I'm down his voice came up clearly From Below but Frodo couldn't see him his gray Elven cloak had melted into the Twilight thodo took rather more time to follow him he had the Rope about his waist and it was fast above and he shortened it so that it would pull him

          
          29:42:42
          up before he reached the ground still he didn't want to risk a fall and he hadn't quite Sam's faith in this slender Gray Line he found two places all the same where he had to trust wholly to it smooth surfaces where there was no hold even for his strong Hobbit fingers and the The Ledges were far apart but at last he to was down well he cried we've done it we've escaped from the EM Mo and now what next I wonder maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock Under Foot again but Sam didn't answer he was staring back up

          
          29:43:22
          the cliff nin hammers he said noodles my beautiful rope there it is tied to a stump and we at the the bottom just as nice A little stare for that slinking Gollum as we could leave better put up a signpost to say which way we've gone I thought it seemed a bit too easy if you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet brought it down with us then you can pass on to me nin hammer or any other name your gaffer gave you said fodo climb up and untie it and let yourself down if you want to Sam scratched his

          
          29:44:00
          head no I can't think how begging your pardon he said but I don't like leaving it and that's a fact he stroked the rope's end and shook it gently it goes hard parting with anything I brought out of the elf country made by gadriel herself too maybe gadriel he murmured nodding his head mournfully he looked up and gave one last pull to the Rope as if in farewell to the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose Sam fell over and the long gray coil slithered silently down on top of him Frodo

          
          29:44:38
          laughed who tied the Rope he said a good thing it held as long as it did to think that I trusted all my weight to your knot Sam didn't laugh I may not be much good at climbing Mr Frodo he said in injured tones but I do know something about rope and about knots it's in the family as you might say why my Granddad and my Uncle Andy after him him that was the gaffer's eldest brother he had a rope walk over by tyfield many a year and I put as fast a hitch over the stump as anyone could have done in the Shire or out of it then

          
          29:45:18
          the Rope must have broken Frayed on the rockedge I expect said Frodo I bet it didn't said Sam in an even more injured voice he stooped and examined the ends nor it hasn't neither not a strand then I'm afraid it must have been the knot said Frodo Sam shook his head and didn't answer he was passing the Rope through his fingers thoughtfully have it your own way Mr Frodo he said at last but I think the Rope came off itself when I called he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack it certainly came

          
          29:45:54
          said Frodo and that's the chief thing but now we've got to think of our next move KN will be on us soon how beautiful the stars are and the moon they do cheer the heart don't they said Sam looking up Elish they are somehow and the moon's growing we haven't seen him for a night or two in this cloudy weather he's beginning to give quite a light yes said Frodo but he won't be full for some days I don't think we'll try the marshes by the light of half a moon under the first Shadows of night they started out on the next stage of

          
          29:46:30
          their Journey after a while Sam turned and looked back at the way they'd come the mouth of the galy was a black notch in the dim Cliff I'm glad we've got the Rope he said we've set a little puzzle for that foot pad anyhow he can try his nasty Flappy feet on those Ledges they picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff among A wilderness of Boulders and rough Stones wet and slippery with a heavy rain the ground still fell away sharply they' not gone very far when they came upon a great Fisher that yawned suddenly black

          
          29:47:07
          before their feet it was not wide but it was too wide to jump across in the dim light they thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths it curved away on their left northward back towards the hills and so bar their Road in that direction at any rate while Darkness lasted we'd better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff I think said Sam we might find some Nook there or even a cave or something I suppose so said Frodo I'm tired and I don't think I can scramble among Stones

          
          29:47:43
          much longer tonight though I Grudge the delay I wish there was a clear path in front of us then I'd go on till my legs gave way they didn't find the going any easier at the broken feet of the EM wheel nor did Sam find any Nook or Hollow to shelter in only bare stonely slopes frowned over by the cliff which now rose again higher and more sheer as they went back in the end worn out they just cast themselves on the ground under the Lee of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the precipice there for some time they sat

          
          29:48:20
          huddled mournfully together in the cold Stony night while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off the moon now rode high and clear its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks and wrenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff turning all the wide looming Darkness into a chill pale gray scored with black Shadows well said Frodo standing up and drawing his cloak more closely around him you sleep for a bit Sam and take my blanket I'll walk up and down on Sentry for a while suddenly he stiffened and

          
          29:48:57
          stooping he gripped Sam by the arm what's that he he whispered look over there on the cliff Sam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth sh he said that's what it is it's that Gollum snakes and adders and to think that I thought that we'd puzzle him with our bit of a climb look at him like a nasty crawling spider on a wall down the face of a precipice sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the pale Moonlight a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs play out maybe its soft clinging hands and

          
          29:49:40
          Toes were finding crevices and holes that no Hobbit could ever have seen or used but it looked as if it were just creeping down on sticky pads like some large prowling thing of insect kind and it was coming down head first as if it was smelling its way now and again it lifted its head slowly turning it right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights its eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lded again do you think he can see us said

          
          29:50:17
          Sam I don't know said Frodo quietly but I think not it's hard even for friendly eyes to see those elen cloaks I cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces and I've heard that he doesn't like sun or moon then why is he coming down just here asked Sam quietly Sam said Frodo he can smell us perhaps and he can hear as Keen as elves I believe I think he has heard something now our voices probably we did a lot of shouting away back there and we were talking far too loudly until a minute ago well I'm sick of him said Sam he's

          
          29:50:58
          come once too often for me and I'm going to have a word with him if I can I don't suppose we could give him the slip now anyway drawing his gray Hood well over his face Sam crept stealthily towards the cliff careful whispered Frodo coming behind don't alarm him he's much more dangerous than he looks the black crawling shape was now 3/4 of the way down and perhaps 50 feet or less above the Cliff's foot crouching Stone still in the shadow of a large Boulder the hobbits watch him he seemed to have come

          
          29:51:33
          to a difficult passage or to be troubled about something they could hear him snuffling and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a curse he lifted his head and they thought they heard him spit then he moved on again now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling cautious my precious more Hast L speed we mustn't risk our neck Mastery precious no precious he lifted his head again blinked at the moon and quickly shut his eyes we hate it he hissed nasty shivery light it is it spies on us precious it

          
          29:52:28
          hurts our eyes he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer where is it where is it my precious my precious it's ours it is and we want it the thieves the thieves the filthy little thieves where are they with my precious cast them we hate them it doesn't sound as if he knew we were here doesn't it whispered Sam and what his precious does he mean the sh breathed Frodo he's getting near now near enough to hear a whisper indeed Gollum had suddenly paused again and his large head on its

          
          29:53:15
          scrawny neck was lulling from side to side as if he was listening his pale eyes were half uned Sam restrained himself though his fingers were twitching his eyes filled with anger and disgust were fixed on the The Wretched creature as he now began to move again still whispering and hissing to himself at last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground right above their heads from that point there was a sheer drop for the cliff was slightly undercut and even Gollum could not find a hold of any kind he seemed to be

          
          29:53:51
          trying to twist round so as to go legs first when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell as he did so he cured his legs and arms up around him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped Sam was out of his hiding in a Flash and crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps before Gollum could get up he was on top of him but he found Gollum more than he bargained for even taken like that suddenly off his guard after a fall before Sam could get a hold long legs

          
          29:54:27
          and arms were wound round him pinning his arms and a singing grip soft but horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords clammy fingers were feeling for his throat then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder all he could do was to butt his hard head sideways into the creature's face Gollum hissed and spat but he didn't let go things would have gone ill with Sam if he'd been alone but Frodo sprang up and Drew Sting from its sheath with his left hand and he drew back gollum's head by his thin lank hair stretching his

          
          29:55:04
          long neck and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky let go Gollum he said this is Sting you've seen it before Once Upon a Time let go or you'll feel it this time I'll cut your throat Gollum collapsed and went as Loose as wet string Sam got up fingering his shoulder his eyes smoldered with anger but he could not avenge himself his miserable enemy leg gring on the stones whimpering don't hurt us don't let them hurt us precious they won't hurt us will they nice little hobbitses we didn't mean them no harm

          
          29:55:45
          but they jumps on us like cats on poor mes they did precious and we're so [Music] lonely we'll be nice to them very nice if they you'll be nice to us won't we yes yes well what's to be done with it said Sam tie it up so as it can't come sneaking after us no more I say but that would kill us kill us whimpered Gollum cruel little hobby chairs tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us G sobs welled up in his gobbling throat no said Frodo if we kill him we must kill him outright but we can't do

          
          29:56:35
          that not as things are poor wretch he's done us no harm oh hasn't he said Sam rubbing his shoulder anyway he meant to and he means to I'll warrant throttle us in our sleep that's his plan I dare say said Frodo but what he means to do is another matter he paused for a while and thought Gollum lay still but stopped whimpering Sam stood glowering over him it seemed to Frodo then that he heard quite plainly but far off voices out of the past what a Pity Bilbo did not stab the vile creature when he had a chance pity

          
          29:57:20
          it was pity that stayed his hand pity and mercy not to strike without need I don't feel any pity for Gollum he deserves death deserve death I dare say he does many that live deserve death and some die that deserve life can you give that to them then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of Justice fearing for your own safety even the wise cannot see all ends very well he answered aloud lowering a sword but still I'm afraid and yet as you see I won't touch the creature for now that I see him I do

          
          29:57:59
          pity him Sam stared at his master who seemed to be speaking to someone who was not there Gollum lifted his head yes riched we are precious he whed misery misery Hobbits won't kill us nice Hobbits no we won't said Frodo but we won't let you go either you're full of wickedness and Mischief Gollum you'll have to come with us that's all while we keep an eye on you but you must help us if you can one good turn deserves another yes yes indeed said Gollum sitting up nice hobit will'll come with them find them safe paths in the dark

          
          29:58:45
          yes we will and where are they going in these cold hard lands we wonders yes we wonders he looked up at them and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second in his pale blinking eyes Sam scowled at him and sucked his teeth but he seemed to sense that there was something odd about his master's mood and that the matter was beyond argument all the same he was amazed at Frodo's reply Frodo looked straight into gollum's eyes which flinched and twisted away you know that or you guess well

          
          29:59:20
          enough smeagle he said quietly and sternly we are going to Mordor of course and you know the way there I believe ah sh said go golum covering his ears with his hands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him we gu yes we gued he whispered and we didn't want them to go did we no precious not the nice hobit ashes ashes and dust and thirst there is and pitch pitch pitch and Orcs thousands of ores nice Hobbits mustn't go to sh those places so you have been there Frodo insisted and you're being drawn back

          
          30:00:12
          there aren't you yes yes no shrieked Gollum once by accident it was wasn't it precious yes by accident but we won't go back no no then suddenly his voice and language changed and he sobbed in his throat and spoke but not to them leave me alone colum you heard me oh my poor hands I we I don't want to come back I can't find it I'm tired I we can't find it no nowhere they're always awake dwarves men and elves take terrible elves with bright eyes I can't find it he got up and clenched his long hand

          
          30:01:08
          into a bony fleshless knot shaking it towards the east we won't he cried not for you then he collapsed again colum colum he whimpered with his face to the ground don't look at us go away go to sleep he won't go away or go to sleep at your command smeagle said Frodo but if you really wish to be free of him again then you must help me and that I fear means finding us a path towards him but you needn't go all the way not beyond the gates of his land Gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids he's over there he cackled

          
          30:01:54
          always there Orcs will take you all the way easy to find or walks east of the river don't ask smeel poor poor smeel he went away long ago they took his precious and he's lost now perhaps we'll find him again if you come with us said fro no no never he's lost his precious said Gollum get up said Frodo Gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff now said Frodo can you find a path Easier by day or by by night we're tired but if you choose the night we'll start tonight the big lights hurt our eyes

          
          30:02:38
          they do colum whined not under the white face not yet it will go behind the hills soon yes rest a bit first th Hobbits then sit down said Frodo and don't move The Hobbit seated themselves beside him one on either side with the their backs to the Stony wall resting their legs there was no need for any Arrangement by word they knew that they mustn't sleep for a moment slowly the moon went by Shadows fell down from the hills and all grew dark before them the Stars grew thick and bright in the sky above no one stirred Gollum sat with his

          
          30:03:23
          legs drawn up knees under chin flat hands and feet sped on the ground his eyes closed but he seemed tense as if thinking or listening Frodo looked across at Sam their eyes met and they understood they relaxed leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming to soon the sound of this soft breathing could be heard gollum's hands twitched a little hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the right and first one eye and then the other opened a slit the hobbits made no sign suddenly with startling agility and

          
          30:04:04
          speed straight off the ground with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog Gollum bounded forward into the darkness but that was just what Frodo and Sam had expected Sam was on him before he had gone two paces after his spring Frodo coming behind grabbed his legs and threw him your rope might be useful Again Sam he said Sam got out the rope and where were you off to in the cold hard lands Mr Gollum he growled we wonders I we wonders to find some of your orc friends I warrant you nasty treacherous creature

          
          30:04:39
          it's round your neck this rope ought to go and a tight noose too Gollum L quiet and tried no further tricks he didn't answer Sam but gave him a swift venomous look all we need is something to keep a hold on him said Frodo we want him to walk so it's no good tying his legs or his arms he seems to use them nearly as much tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other end he stood over Gollum while Sam tied the knot the result surprised them both Gollum began to scream a thin tearing sound very

          
          30:05:17
          horrible to hear he wried and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the Rope he kept on screaming at last Frodo was convinced that he really was in pain but it couldn't be from the not he examined it and found that it wasn't too tight indeed hardly tight enough Sam was gentler than his words what's the matter with you he said if you'll try to run away you must be tied but we don't wish to hurt you it hurts us it hurts us hissed Gollum it freezes it bites elves Twisted it to curse them nasty cruel Hobbit

          
          30:05:59
          that's why we tries to escape of course it is precious we guessed they were cruel Hobbits they visit elves Fierce elves with bright eyes take it off us it hurts us no I won't take it off you said Frodo not unless he paused a moment in thought not unless there is any promise you can make that I can trust we will swear to do what he wants yes yes said Gollum still twisting and grabbing at his ankle it hurts us swear said Frodo smigle said Gollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide and staring at

          
          30:06:40
          Frodo with a strange light smeagle will swear on the precious Frodo Drew himself up and again Sam was startled by his words and his Stern voice on the precious how dare you he said think one ring to rule them all and and in the darkness bind them would you commit your promise to that smeagle it will hold you but it's more treacherous than you are it may twist your words beware Gollum coward on the precious on the precious he repeated and what would you swear asked Frodo to be very very good said Gollum then crawling

          
          30:07:24
          to Frodo's feet he groveled before him Whispering hely a shudder ran over him as if the words shook his very bones with fear smeel will swear never never to let him have it never smigle will save it but he must swear on the precious no not on it said Frodo looking down at him with Stern pity all you wish is to see it and touch it if you can though you know it would drive you mad not on it swear by it if you will for you know know where it is yes you know smeel it's before you for a moment it appeared to Sam that

          
          30:08:06
          his master had grown and gollom it shrunk a tall Stern Shadow a mighty Lord who hit his brightness in gray cloud and At His Feet a little whining dog yet the two were in some way Akin and not alien they could reach one another's Minds Gollum raised himself and began pouring at Frodo foring at his knees down down said Frodo now speak your promise we promises yes I promise said Gollum I will serve the master of the precious good Master good meum suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again take the Rope off Sam

          
          30:08:51
          said Frodo reluctantly Sam obeyed at once Gollum got up and began prancing about like a whipped CER whose Master had has patted it from that moment a change which lasted for some time came over him he spoke with less hissing and whining and he spoke to his companions direct not to his precious self he would cringe and Flinch if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement and he avoided the touch of their Elven cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitifully anxious to please he would cackle with laughter and

          
          30:09:27
          Caper if any Gest was made or even if Frodo spoke kindly to him and weep if Frodo rebuked him Sam said little to him of any sort he suspected him more deeply than ever and if possible liked the new Gollum the smeagle less than the old well golum or whatever it is where to call you he said now for it the moon's gone and the night's going we better start yes yes agreed Gollum skipping about off we go there's only one way across between the North End and the south end I found it I did Orcs don't use it Hawks don't know it Hawks don't

          
          30:10:11
          cross the marshes they go around for miles and miles very lucky you came this way very lucky you found smeagle yes follow smeagle he took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly like a dog inviting them for a walk wait a bit Gollum cried Sam not too far ahead now I'm going to beat your tail and I've got the Rope handy no no said Gollum SME promised in the Deep of Night Under hard clear Stars they set off Gollum LED them back northward for a while along the way that they had come then he slanted to

          
          30:10:52
          the right away from the Steep edge of the EM mu down the broken Stony slopes towards the vast fins below they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness over all the leagues of waste before the gates of Mordor there was a black silence chapter 2 the passage of the marshes Gollum moved quickly with his head and neck thrust forward often using his hands as well as his feet Frodo and Sam were hard put to it to keep up with him but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping and if they fell

          
          30:11:36
          behind he would turn and wait for them after a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow Gully that they had struck before but they were now further down the hills here it is he cried there is a way down in sight yes now we follows it out out the way over there he pointed south and east towards the marshes the reek of them came to the nostrils heavy and foul even in the cool night air Gollum cast up and down along the brink and at length he called to them here we can get down here smeel went this way once I went this way

          
          30:12:23
          hiding from Orcs he led the way and following him the hobbits climbed down into the Gloom it was not difficult for the rift was at this point only some 15 ft deep and about a dozen across there was running water at the bottom it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and Mars Beyond Gollum turned to the right Southward more or less and splashed along with his feet in the shallow Stony stream he seemed greatly delighted to

          
          30:12:59
          feel the the water and Chuckles to himself sometimes even croaking in the sort of song the cold hard lands they bites our hands they Noss our feet the rocks and stones are like old bones all be of meat but stream and pool is wet and cool so nice for feet and now we will what does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits we'll tell you he croaked he guessed it long ago beins guessed it a glint came into his eyes and Sam catching The Gleam in the darkness thought it far from Pleasant I live without breath as cold

          
          30:13:56
          as death never thirsty never drinking clad in mail never clinking drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountain thinks a fountain is a puff of air so Sleek so fair what a joy to meet we only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet these words only made more pressing to Sam's mind a problem that had been troubling him from the moment when he understood that his master was going to adopt Gollum as a guide the problem of food it didn't occur to him that his master might also have thought of it but

          
          30:14:47
          he supposed Gollum had indeed how had Gollum kept himself in all his lonely wondering not too well thought Sam he looks Fair famished not too dainty to try what Hobbit tastes like if there ain't no fish I'll wager supposing as he could catch us napping well he won't not Sam gamji for one they stumbled along in the dark winding Gully for a long time or so it seemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam the Gully turned Eastward and as they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower at last the sky above grew

          
          30:15:28
          faint with the first gray of morning Gollum had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and halted day is near he whispered as if day was something that might overhear him and spring on him smigle will stay here I will stay here and the yellow face won't see me we should be glad to see the sun said Frodo but we'll stay here we're too tired to go on any further at present present you're not wise to be glad of the yellow face said Gollum it shows you up nice sensible Hobbit stay with smeagle Orcs and nasty things are about

          
          30:16:13
          they can see a long way stay and hide with me the three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the galley it was not much more than a tall man's height now and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry Stone the water ran in a channel on the other side Frodo and Sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the Stream we must take a little food said rodo are you hungry smeagle we have very little to share but we will spare you what we

          
          30:16:50
          can at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in gollum's pale eyes and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face for a moment he relapsed into his old Gollum manner we are famished yes famished we are precious he said what is it they eat have they nice fishes his tongue lulled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his colorless lips no we've got no fish said Frodo we have only got this he held up a wafer of lmar and water if the water is fit to drink yes yes nice water said golum

          
          30:17:37
          drink it drink it while we can but what is it they've got precious is it crun is it tasty Frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its Leaf wrapping Gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed a spasm of disgust came over it and a hint of his old malice smeagle smells it he said leaves out of the elf country they stinks he climbed in those trees and he couldn't wash the smell off his hands my nice hands dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lmas and nibbled it he spat and a

          
          30:18:23
          fit of coughing shook him ah no he spluttered you tried to choke Smiggle dust the dashes he can't eat that he must starve but Smiggle doesn't mind nice Hobbits smeagle has promised he will starve he can't eat Hobbits food he will star poor thin smeel I'm sorry said Frodo but I can't help you I'm afraid I think this food would do you good if you would try but perhaps you can't even try not yet anyway the hobbits munched their lmas in silence Sam thought it had tasted far better somehow than it had for a good

          
          30:19:09
          while gollum's Behavior had made him attend to its flavor again but he didn't feel comfortable Gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth like an expectant dog by a Diner's chair only when they'd finished and were preparing to rest was he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could chair in then he went and sat by himself a few Paces away and whimpered a little look here Sam whispered to Frodo not too softly he didn't really care whether Gollum heard him or not we've

          
          30:19:44
          got to get some sleep but not both together with that hungry villain nigh promise or no promise smeagle or Gollum he won't change his habits in a hurry I'll warrant you go to sleep Mr Frodo and I'll call you when I can't keep my eyelids propped up turnning about same as before while he's loose perhaps you're right Sam said Frodo speaking openly there is a change in him but just what kind of change and how deep I'm not sure yet seriously though I don't think there's any need for fear at present still watch if you

          
          30:20:22
          wish give me about two hours not more and then call me so tired was Frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept almost as soon as he'd spoken the words Gollum seemed no longer to have any fears he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconcerned presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth but he lay still a stone after a while fearing that he'd drop off himself if he sat listening to his two companions breathing Sam got up and gently proded Gollum his hands uncurled

          
          30:20:58
          and twitched but he made no other movement Sam bent down and said close to his ear but there was no response not even a catch in gollum's breathing Sam scratched his head must really be asleep he muttered and if I was like Gollum he wouldn't wake up never again he restrained the thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind and went and sat down by his master when he woke up the sky above was dim not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted Sam leapt to his feet not least from his own feeling of

          
          30:21:37
          vigor and hunger he suddenly understood that he'd slept the daylight away 9 hours at least floo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side Gollum wasn't to be seen various reproachful names for himself came to Sam's mind drawn from the gaffer's large paternal word horde then it also occurred to him that his master had been right there had for the present been nothing to guard against they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled poor wret he said half remorselessly now I wonder where he's

          
          30:22:15
          got to that far that far said a voice above him he looked up and saw the shape of gollum's large head and ears against the evening sky here what are you doing cried Sam his suspicions coming back as soon as he saw the shape smigle is hungry said gum be back soon come back now shouted Sam hi come back but Gollum had vanished Frodo woke at the sound of Sam shout and sat up rubbing his eyes hello he said anything wrong what's the time I don't know said Sam after Sundown I reckon and he's gone off says he's hungry don't

          
          30:22:58
          worry said fro there's no help for it but he'll come back you'll see the Promise will hold yet a while and he won't leave his precious anyway Frodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for hours with Gollum and a very hungry golum too loose beside them don't think of any of your gaffer's heart names he said you were worn out and it's turned out well we are now both rested and we've A Hard Road Ahead the worst Road of all about the food said Sam how long is it going to take us to do this job

          
          30:23:37
          and when it's done what are we going to do then this way bread keeps you on your legs in a wonderful way though it doesn't satisfy the inance proper as you might say not to my feeling anyhow meaning no disrespect to them has made it but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesn't grow I reckon we've got enough to last say 3 weeks or so and that with a tight belt and a light tooth mind you we've been a bit free with it so far I don't know how long we shall take to to finish said Frodo we were miserably delayed in

          
          30:24:16
          the Hills but Sam wise gamji my dear Hobbit indeed Sam my dearest Hobbit friend of friends I don't think we need give thought to what comes after that to do the job as you put it what hope is there that we ever shall and if we do who knows what will come of that if the one goes into the fire and we are at hand I ask you Sam are we ever likely to need bread again I think not if we can nurse our limbs to bring us to Mount Doom that's all we can do more than I can I begin to feel Sam nodded silently he took his Master's

          
          30:24:57
          Hand and bent over over it he didn't kiss it though his tears fell on it then he turned away drew his sleeve over his nose and got up and stamped about trying to whistle and saying between the efforts where's that Dred creature it was actually not long before Gollum returned but he came so quietly that they didn't hear him till he stood before them his fingers and face were soiled with black mud he was still chewing and slaving what he was chewing they didn't ask or like to think worms or beetles or something

          
          30:25:34
          slimy out of holes thought Sam the nasty creature the poor wretch Gollum said nothing to them until he' drunk deeply and washed himself in the Stream then he came up to them licking his lips better now he said are we rested ready to go on nice homage I sleep beautifully trust smeagle now very very good the next stage of their Journey was much the same as the last as they went on the Gully became even shallower and the slope of its floor more gradual its bottom was less Stony and more earthy and slowly its sides dwindled to Mere

          
          30:26:22
          Banks it began to wind and wander that night Drew to its end but clouds were now over moon and star and they knew of the coming of day only by the slow spreading of the thin gray light in a chill hour they came to the end of the water course the banks became Moss grown Mounds over the last shelf of rotting Stone the stream gurgled and fell down into a brown bog and was lost dry reads hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind on either side and in front wide fence and Mars now lay stretching away

          
          30:27:01
          Southward and Eastward into the dim Half Light Mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools the reek of them hung stifling in the still air far away now almost due south the mountain walls of Mordor loomed like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog bound sea the hobbits were now holy in the hands of Gollum they didn't know and couldn't guess in that Misty light that they were in fact only just within the northern borders of the marshes the main expans of which lay south of them they

          
          30:27:42
          could if they had known the lands with some delay have retraced their steps a little and then turning East have come round over hard roads to the bare Plaine of dagad the field of the ancient Battle Before the gates of Mordor not that there was great hope in such a course on that Stony plane there was no cover and across it ran the highways of the Orcs And the soldiers of the enemy not even the cloaks of lauan would have concealed them there how do we shape our course now smeel asked Frodo must we cross these

          
          30:28:17
          evil smelling F No need no need at all said Gollum not if Hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and go to seea him very quick back a little and round a little his skinny arm waved north and east and you can come on hard cold roads to the very Gates of his country lots of his people will be there looking out for guests very pleased to take them straight to him oh yes his eye watches that way all the time it caught smeagle there long ago Colum shuttered but smeagle has used his eyes since then yes yes I've used

          
          30:29:04
          eyes and feet and nose since then I know other ways more difficult not so quick but better if we don't want him to see follow smeel he can take you through the marshes Through The Mists nice thick Mists follow smeagle very carefully and you may go a long way qu quite a long way before he catches you yes perhaps it was all ready day a windless and suen morning and the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks no sun pierced the low clouded sky and Gollum seemed anxious to continue the journey at once so after a

          
          30:29:51
          brief rest they set out again and were soon lost in the shadowy silent World cut off from all view of the lands about either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought they went slowly in single file Gollum Sam Frodo Frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow though they went he often lagged The Hobbit soon found that what had looked like one vast Fen was really an endless network of pools and soft Mars and winding half strangled water courses among these a cunning eye and foot could

          
          30:30:30
          thread a Wandering path Gollum certainly had that cunning and needed all of it his head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them while he went forward a little crouching testing the ground with fingers or Toes or merely listening with one ear pressed to the Earth it was dreary and wearisome cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsaken country The only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark

          
          30:31:07
          greasy surfaces of the suen waters dead grasses and rotting weeds loomed up in the midsts like ragged Shadows of long forgotten Summers as the day wore on the light increased a little and The Mists lifted growing thinner and more transparent far above the rot and Vapors of the world the sun was riding high and golden now in a Serene country with flaws of dazzling foam but only a passing ghost of her could they see below bed pale giving no color and no warmth but even at this faint reminder of her presence Gollum scowled and

          
          30:31:49
          flinched he halted their journey and they rested squatting like little hunted animals in the borders of a great Brown Reed th it there was a deep silence only scraped on its surface by The Faint quiver of empty seed plumes and broken grass blades trembling in small air movements that they could not feel not a bird said Sam mournfully no no birds said Gollum nice Birds he licked his lips no birds here that a snake sh worm sh things in the pools lots of things lots of nasty things no birds he ended sadly Sam

          
          30:32:37
          looked at him with distaste so pass the third day of their Journey with Gollum before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands they went on again always on and on with only brief halts these they made not so much for rest as to help Gollum for now even he had to go forward with great care and he was sometimes at a loss for a while they'd come to the very midst of the Dead marshes and it was dark they walked slowly stooping keeping close in line following attentively every move that Gollum made the fence

          
          30:33:18
          grew more wet opening into wide stagnant mirrors amongst which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking to gurgling Mud The Travelers were light or maybe none of them would ever have found a way through presently it grew all together dark the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe when lights appeared Sam rubbed his eyes he thought his head was going queer he first saw one with a corner of his left eye a whsp of pale Sheen that faded away but others

          
          30:33:56
          appeared soon after some like dimly shining smoke some like Misty Flames flickering slowly above unseen candles here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands but neither of his companions spoke a word at last Sam could bear it no longer what all this Gollum he said in a whisper these lights they're all around us now are we trapped who are they golum looked up a dark water was before him and he was crawling on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way yes they are all around us he whispered the

          
          30:34:37
          Trixie lights candles of corpse say yes yes don't you heed them don't look don't follow them where's the master Sam looked back and found that Frodo had lagged again he couldn't see him he went some paces back into the darkness not daring to move far or to call in more than a horse whisper suddenly he stumbled against thodo who was standing lost in thought looking at the pale lights his hands hung stiff at his sides water and slime were dripping from them come Mr Frodo said Sam don't look at them colum says we mustn't let's

          
          30:35:22
          keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as we can if we can all all right said Frodo as if returning out of a dream I'm coming go on hurrying forward Again Sam tripped catching his foot in some old root or Tusk he fell and came heavily on his hands which sank deep into sticky ooze so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mirror there was a faint hiss a noisome smell went up the lights flickered and danced and swirled for a moment the water below him looked

          
          30:35:56
          like some window glazed with grimy glass through which he was peering wrenching his hands out of the bog he sprang back with a cry there are dead things Dead faces in the water he said with horror Dead faces colum laughed the dead marshes yes yes that is their names he cackled you shouldn't look in when the candles are lit who are they what are they asked shuddering turning to Frodo who was now behind him I don't know said Frodo in a dreamlike voice but I've seen them too in the pools when the candles

          
          30:36:39
          were lit they lie in all the pools pale faces deep deep under the Dark Water I saw them Grim faces and evil and Noble faces and sad many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair but all foul all rotting all dead a fell light is in them Frodo hid his eyes in his hands I know not who they are but I thought I saw their men and elves and Orcs beside them yes yes said Gollum all dead all rotten elves and men and Oaks the dead mares there was a great battle long ago yes so they told him when smeagle was

          
          30:37:30
          young when I was young before the precious came it was a great battle tall men with long swords and terrible elves and Orcs as shrieking they fought on the plane for days and months at the black Gates but the marshes have grown since then swallowing up the graves always creeping creeping but that's an agan ago said Sam the dead can't be really there is it some devilry hatched in the dark land who knows smeel doesn't know answered Gollum you cannot reach them you cannot touch them we tried once Yes precious I

          
          30:38:15
          tried once but you cannot reach them only shapes to see perhaps not to touch no precious all day Sam looked Darkly at him and shuted again thinking that he guessed why smeel had tried to touch them well I don't want to see them he said never again can't we get on and get away oh yes said Gollum but slowly very slowly very carefully or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles follow smeagle don't look at lights he crawled away to the right seeking for a path around the mirror they came close

          
          30:39:04
          behind stooping often using their hands even as he did three precious little golems in a row we shall be if this goes on much longer thought Sam at last they came to the end of the Black Mirror and they crossed it perilously crawling or hopping from one treacherous Island Tusk to another often they floundered stepping or falling hands first into Waters as noisome as a cesspool till they were slimed and fouled almost up to their necks and stank in one another's nostrils it was late in the night when

          
          30:39:42
          at length they reached firmer ground again Gollum hissed and whispered to himself but it appeared that he was pleased in some mysterious Way by some Blended sense of feel and smell and uncanny memory for shapes in the dark he seemed to know just where he was again and to be sure of his road again now on we go he said nice hobbit Brave Hobbit very very weary of course so we are my precious all of us but we must take Master away from the wicked lights yes yes we must with these words he started off

          
          30:40:22
          again almost at a trot down what appeared to be a long Lane between High reads and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could but in a little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again what is it growled Sam misinterpreting the signs what's the need to sniff the stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held you stink and master stinks the whole place stinks yes yes and Sam stinks answered Gollum poor smeagle smells it but good smeagle Bears it helps nice

          
          30:41:04
          master but that's no matter the air is moving change is coming smeagle wonders he's not happy he went on again but his uneasiness grew and every now and again he stood up to his full height craning his neck Eastward and Southward for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him him then suddenly all three halted stiffening and listening to Frodo and Sam it seemed that they heard far away A Long wailing cry high and thin and cruel they shivered at the same moment the stirling

          
          30:41:43
          of the air became perceptible to them and it grew very cold as they stood straining their ears they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance the Misty lights wavered dimmed and went out Gollum wouldn't move he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with a rush the wind Came Upon them hissing and snarling over the marshes the night became less dark light enough for them to see or half see shapeless drifts of fog curling and twisting as it rolled over them and past them looking up they saw the clouds

          
          30:42:19
          breaking and shredding and then high in the South the moon glimmered out riding in the flying rack for a moment the sight it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits but Gollum cowed down muttering curses on the white face then Frodo and Sam staring at the sky breathing deeply of the fresher air saw it come a small Cloud flying from the accursed hills a black shadow loosed from Mordor a vast shape winged and ominous it scattered across the moon and with a deadly cry went away Westward out running the wind in its fell speed

          
          30:42:58
          they fell forward groeling heedlessly on the cold Earth but the shadow of horror wheeled and returned passing lower now right above them sweeping the fenek with its ghastly wings and then it was gone flying back to Mordor with the speed of the Roth of saurin and behind it the wind roared away leaving the dead marshes bare and Bleak the naked waste as far as the eye could Pierce even to the distant Menace of the mountains was dappled with a fitful Moonlight Frodo and Sam got up rubbing their eyes like children wakened from an

          
          30:43:36
          evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world but Gollum lay on the ground as if he'd been stunned they roused him with difficulty and for some time he wouldn't lift his face but knelt forward on his elbows covering the back of his head with his large flat hands W he wailed w on wings the precious is their Master they see everything everything nothing can hide from them curse the white face and they tell him everything he sees he knowsum it was not until the moon had sunk westering far beyond tall brandia

          
          30:44:25
          that he would get up or make a move from that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again he was more fawning and would be friendly but Sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times especially towards Frodo and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking and Sam had another growing anxiety Frodo seemed to be weary weary to the point of exhaustion he said nothing indeed he hardly spoke at all and he didn't complain but he walked like one who carries a load the weight of which

          
          30:45:05
          is ever increasing and he dragged along slower and slower so that Sam had often to beg Gollum to wait and not to leave their Master behind in fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor froda felt the ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome he was now beginning to feel it as an actual waight dragging him earthwards but far more he was troubled by the eye so he called it to himself it was that more than the drag of the ring that made him cow and stoop as he walked the eye that horrible

          
          30:45:43
          growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all Shadows of cloud and Earth and flesh and to see you to pin you under its deadly gaze naked immovable able so thin so frail and thin the veils were become that still wed it off Frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow Gollum probably felt something of the same sort but what went on in his

          
          30:46:26
          wretched heart between the pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring that was so near and his groeling promise made half in the fear of cold iron the hobbits didn't guess Frodo gave no thought to it Sam's mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the Dark Cloud that had fallen on his own heart he put Frodo in front of him now and kept a watchful eye on every movement of his supporting him if he stumbled and trying to encourage him with Clumsy words when day came at last the hobbits

          
          30:47:02
          were surprised to see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn the air was now clearer and colder and though still far off the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy Menace on the edge of sight but as Grim black Towers they frowned across a dismal waist the marshes were at an end dying away into dead pets and wide Flats of dry cracked mud the land ahead Rose in Long shallow slopes Barren and pitiless towards the desert that lay at sauron's gate while the gray light lasted they cowed under a

          
          30:47:39
          black stone like worms shrinking lest the winged Terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes the remainder of that Journey was a shadow of growing fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon but two more nights they struggled on through the weary path less land the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths at last on the fifth morning since they took the road with Gollum they halted once more before them dark

          
          30:48:15
          in the dawn the great mountains reached up to rofes of smoke and Cloud out from their feet were flung huge butresses and broken Hills that were now at the nearest scarce dozen miles away Frodo looked around him in horror Dreadful as the dead marshes had been and the Arid Moors of the no man lands more loathsome far was the country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes even to the mirror of dead faces some hagged Phantom of Green Spring would come but here neither spring nor

          
          30:48:51
          summer would ever come again here nothing lived not even than the leprous grows that feed on rottenness the Gasping pools were choked with Ash and crawling muds sickly white and gray as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about high mounds of crushed and powdered Rock great cones of Earth fire blasted and poison stained stood like an obscene graveyard in Endless Rose slowly revealed in The Reluctant light they had come to the Desolation that lay before Mordor the lasting

          
          30:49:31
          Monument to the dark labor of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were made void a land defiled diseased beyond all healing unless the great sea should enter in and wash it with Oblivion I feel sick said Sam Frodo didn't speak for a while they stood there like men on the edge of asleep where nightmare lurks holding it off though they know that they can only come to mourning through the Shadows the light broadened and hardened the Gasping pits and poisonous Mounds grew hideously clear the sun was up

          
          30:50:13
          walking among clouds and long flags of smoke but even the sunlight was defiled the hbits had no welcome for that light unfriendly it seemed revealing them in their helplessness little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the ash heaps of the dark lord too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest for a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag but foul fumes leaked out of it catching their throats and choking them colum was the first to get up spluttering and cursing

          
          30:50:49
          he rose and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours Frodo and Sam crawled after him until they came to a wide almost circular pit High banked upon the West it was cold and dead and a foul sump of oily many colored ooze lay at its bottom in this evil hole they cowed hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the eye the day passed slowly a great thirst troubled them but they drank only a few drops from their bottles last filled in the Gully which now as they looked back

          
          30:51:27
          in thought seemed to them a place of peace and Beauty the hobbits took it in turn to watch at first tired as they were neither of them could sleep at all but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving Cloud Sam dozed it was Frodo's turn to be on guard he lay back on the slope of the pit but that didn't ease the sense of Burden that was on him he looked up at the smoke streak sky and saw strange Phantoms dark riding shapes and faces out of the past he lost count of time hovering between sleep and

          
          30:52:05
          waking until forgetfulness came over him suddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling it was evening Frodo could not have called for he had fallen asleep and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit God was by him for a moment Sam thought that he was trying to Rouse Frodo then he saw that it was not so Gollum was talking to himself smeagle was holding debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss a pale light and a green light alternated in

          
          30:52:47
          his eyes as he spoke smeal promised said the first voice yes yes my precious came the answer we promised to save our precious not to let him have it never but it's going to him yes near every step what's The Hobbit going to do with it we wonders yes we wonders I don't no I can't help it Master's got it smeagle promised to help the master yes yes to help the master the master of the precious but if we was Master then we could would help ourselves yes and still keep promises but smeagle said he would be

          
          30:53:33
          very good nice hobbit he took cruel rope off smeal's leg he speaks nicely to me very very good a my precious let's be good good as fish sweet one but to ourselves not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no but the precious holds the promise the voice of smeagle objected then take it said the other and let's hold it ourselves then we shall be Master Gollum make the other Hobbit the nasty suspicious Hobbit make him crawl yes Gollum but not the nice hobbit although not if it doesn't please us still he's a

          
          30:54:20
          bgin my precious yes a bin a Beggin stole it he found it and he said nothing nothing we hate begging S no not this beggins yes every beggins all peoples that keep the precious we must have it but he'll see he'll know he'll take it from us he sees he knows he heard us make silly promises against his orders yes must take it the raids are searching must take it not for him no sweet one see my precious if we has it then we can escape even from him he perhaps we grow very strong stronger than rigns Lord

          
          30:55:18
          SME Gollum the great the gollum eat fish every day three times a day fresh from the sea most precious colum must have it we want it we want it we want it but there's two of them they'll wake too quick and kill us whin smle in the last eff not now not yet we want it but and here there was a long pause as if a new thought had awakened not yet a perhaps not she might help she might yes no no not that way wailed smeagle yes we want it we want it each time that the second thought spoke gollum's long hand crept out

          
          30:56:15
          slowly pouring towards Frodo and then was drawn back with a jerk as smigle spoke again finally both arms with long fingers flexed and twitching clawed towards his neck Sam had Lin still fascinated by this debate but watching every move that Gollum made from under his half closed eyelids to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desire to eat Hobbits had seemed the chief danger in Gollum he realized now that it was not so Gollum was feeling the terrible call of the Ring the dark lord was he of course but Sam wondered who she was

          
          30:57:00
          one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings he supposed then he forgot the point for things had plainly gone far enough and were getting dangerous a great heaviness was in all his limbs but he roused himself with an effort and sat up something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn what's the time he said sleepily Gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth he stood up for a moment tense and menacing and then he

          
          30:57:38
          collapsed falling forward onto all fours and crawling up the bank of the pit nice hit nice Sam he said sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeagle to watch but it's evening dusk is creeping TI time to go I time thought Sam and time we parted too yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned Loose as kept with them curse him I wish he was choked he muttered he stumbled down the bank and roused his master strangely enough throda felt refreshed he'd been dreaming the dark shadow had passed and

          
          30:58:25
          a fair vision had visited him in this land of disease nothing remained of it in his memory yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of heart his burden was less heavy on him Gollum welcomed him with doglike Delight he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fingers and pouring at Frodo's knees Frodo smiled at him come he said you've guided us well and Faithfully this is the last stage bring us to the gate and then I'll not ask you to go further bring us to the gate and you may go where you wish only

          
          30:59:02
          not to our enemies to the gate eh Gollum sweeped seeming surprised and frightened to the gate Master says yes he says so and good smeagle does what he asks oh yes but when we gets closer we'll see perhaps we'll see then it won't look nice at all oh no oh no go on on with you said Sam let's get it over in the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the Dead Land they had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the marshes they

          
          30:59:44
          halted cowering on the evil smelling ground but they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above and soon the Menace passed High overhead going maybe on some Swift errand from barad after a while Gollum got up and crept forward again muttering and shaking about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time but it now seemed more remote as if it were passing far above the clouds rushing with terrible speed into the West Gollum however was helpless with Terror and was convinced that they were being hunted

          
          31:00:22
          that their approach was known three times he whimpered three times is a threat they feel us here they feel the precious the precious is their Master we cannot go any further this way no it's no use no use pleading and kind words were no longer of any Avail it was not until Frodo commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword hilt that Gollum would get up again then at last he rose with a snar and went before for them like a beaten dog so they stumbled on through the weary end of the night and until the

          
          31:01:03
          coming of another day of fear they walked in Silence with bowed heads seeing nothing and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears chapter 3 the black gate is closed before the next day dawned their journey to Mordor was over the marshes and the desert were behind them before them darkling against a pared sky the great mountains reared their threatening heads upon the west of Mordor marched the gloomy range of ELD doth the mountains of Shadow and upon the north the broken Peaks and Barren Ridges of

          
          31:01:49
          ared lithu gray as as but as these Rangers approached one another being in indeed but parts of one Great Wall about the mournful Plains of lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bitter Inland Sea of nor and am midmost they swung out long arms northward and between these arms there was a deep defile this was kth goror the haunted pass the entrance to the land of the enemy High Cliffs lowered upon either side and thrust forward from its mouth were two sheer Hills black boned and bear upon them stood the teeth of Mordor

          
          31:02:30
          Two Towers strong and tall in days long past they were built by the men of Gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow of saurin and his flight lest he should seek to return to his old realm but the strength of Gondor failed and Men slept and for long years the towers stood empty then Sauron returned now the Watchtower which had fallen into Decay were repaired and filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance Stony faced there were with dark window holes staring north and east and west

          
          31:03:09
          and each window was full of Sleepless eyes across the mouth of the pass from Cliff to Cliff the dark lord had built a rampart of stone in it there was a single gate of iron and upon its Battlement Sentinels paced unceasingly between the hills on either side The Rock was bored into a 100 caves and maggot holes there a host of Orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war none could pass the teeth of Mordor and not feel their bite unless they were summoned by Sauron or knew the secret passwords that would

          
          31:03:49
          open the the black gate of his land the two Hobbits gazed at the tower and the wall in despair even from a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards upon the wall and the patrols before the gate they lay now peering over the edge of a rocky Hollow beneath the outstretched shadow of the northmost butus of elel dth winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow maybe would have flown but a furong from their hiding place to the black summit of the near Tower a faint

          
          31:04:25
          smoke curled above it as if fire smoldered in the hill beneath day came and the fellow son blinked over the lifeless Ridges of ared lithu then suddenly The Cry of brazen throated trumpets was heard from the watchtowers they bled and far away from hidden holds and outposts in the Hills came answering calls and further still remote but deep and ominous there echoed in the hollow land Beyond The Mighty horns of Drums of bador another Dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor and the night guards were summoned to their Dungeons

          
          31:05:04
          and Dees and the day guards evil eyed and fell were marching to their posts steel gleamed dimly on the Battlement well here we are said Sam here's the gate and it looks to me as if that's about as far as we're ever going to get my word heard but the gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw me now often said I'd come to a bad end if I didn't watch miss stepp it did but now I don't suppose I'll ever see the old fellow again he'll miss his chance of I toally so Sam More's the pity he could go on telling me as long

          
          31:05:46
          as he'd got breath if only I could see his old face again but I'd have to get a wash first or he wouldn't know me I suppose it's no good ask in what way do we go now we can't go no further unless we want to ask the Orcs for a lift no no said Gollum no use we can't go further smeagle said so he said we'll go to the gate and then we'll see and we do see oh yes my precious we do see smeel knew Hobbits could not go this way oh yes smeel knew then what the plague could bring us here for said Sam not feeling in the

          
          31:06:29
          mood to be just or reasonable Master said so Master says bring us to the gate so good smeagle does so Master said so wise master I did said Frodo his face was grim and set but Resolute he was filthy Haggard and pinched with weirdness but he cowed no longer and his eyes were clear I'm I said so because I purposed to enter Mordor and I know no other way therefore I shall go this way I don't ask anyone to go with me no no master wailed Gollum pouring at him and seeming in great distress no use that way no use don't

          
          31:07:14
          take the precious to him he'll eat us all if he gets it eat all the world keep it a nice master and be kind to smeagle don't let him have it or go away go to nice places and give it back to little smeagle yes yes master give it back smeel will keep it safe he will do lots of good especially ton ni Hobbits Hobbits go home don't go to the gate I am commanded to go to the land of Mordor and therefore I shall go said Frodo if there's only one way then I must take it what comes after must come Sam said nothing the look on

          
          31:08:02
          Frodo's face was enough for him he knew that words of his were useless and after all he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning but being a cheerful Hobbit he had not needed hope as long as despair could be postponed now they were come to The Bitter End but he had stuck to his master all the way that was what he'd chiefly come for and he'd still stick to him his master wouldn't go to Mordor alone Sam would go with him and at any rate they would get rid of Gollum Gollum however didn't intend to

          
          31:08:38
          be got rid of yet he knelt at Frodo's feet ringing his hands and squeaking not this way Master he pleaded there's another way oh yes indeed there is another way dark more difficult to find more secret but smeel knows it let smeagle show you another way said Frodo doubtfully looking down at Gollum with searching eyes yes yes indeed there was another way smeagle found it let's go and see if it's still there you haven't spoken of this before no master didn't ask Master didn't say what he meant to do he doesn't tell poor

          
          31:09:24
          smeagle he says smeagle take me to the gate and then goodbye smeel can run away and be good but now he says I purpose to enter moreor this way so smeel is very afraid he doesn't want to lose nice master and he promised Master made him promise to save the precious but Master is going to take it to him straight to the black hand if Master will go this way so smeagle must saved them both and he thinks of another way that there was once upon a time nice master smle very good always helps Sam frowned if he could have board H holdes

          
          31:10:12
          in Gollum with his eyes he would have done his mind was full of Doubt to all appearances Gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo but Sam remembering the overheard debate found it hard to believe that the long submerged smeagle had come out on top that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate Sam's guess was that the smeagle and the gollum harves or what in his own mind he called slinker and stinker had made a truce and a temporary Alliance neither wanted the enemy to get the ring both wished to

          
          31:10:48
          keep Frodo from capture and under their eye as long as possible at any rate as long as stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his prees whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted and it's a good thing neither half of the old villain don't know what Master means to do he thought if he knew that Mr Frodo is trying to put an end to his precious for good and all there'd be trouble pretty quick I bet anyhow old stinker so frightened of the enemy and he's under orders of some kind from him

          
          31:11:22
          or was that he'd give us away rather than than be caught helping us and rather than let his precious be melted maybe at least that's my idea and I hope the master will think it out carefully he's as wise as any but he's soft-hearted that's what he is it's beyond any gamji to guess what he'll do next Frodo didn't answer Gollum at once while these thoughts were passing through Sam's slow but shrewd mind he stood gazing out towards the dark Cliff of kth gorgor the hollow in which they had taken Refuge was delved in the side of a

          
          31:11:59
          low Hill at some little height above a Long trench-like Valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains in the midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western Watchtower by Morning Light the roads that converged upon the Gate of Mordor could now be clearly seen pale and Dusty one winding back northwards another dwindling eastwards Into The Mists that clung about the feet of AED lithy and a third that ran towards him as it bent sharply around the tower it entered a narrow defile and passed not

          
          31:12:34
          far below the hollow where he stood Westward to his right it turned skirting the shoulders of the mountains and went off southwards into the Deep Shadows that mantled all the Western sides of epel doth Beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between the mountains and the Great River as he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement on the plane it seemed as if whole armies were on the March though for the most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the F and wastes

          
          31:13:10
          Beyond but here and there he caught The Gleam of Spears and helmets and over the levels beside the roads Horsemen could be seen riding in many companies he remembered his vision from afar upon Armon hen so few days before the though now it seemed many years ago then he knew that the hope that had for one wild moment stirred in his heart was vain the trumpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting this was no assault upon the Dark Lord by the men of Gondor risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of

          
          31:13:43
          Val long passed away these were men of other race out of the wide Eastlands Gathering to the Summons of their Overlord armies that had encamped before his gate by night and now marched in to swell his mounting power as if suddenly made fully aware of the Peril of their position alone in the growing light of day so near to this vast Menace Frodo quickly drew his frail gray Hood close upon his head and stepped down into the Dell then he turned to Gollum smeagle he said I'll Trust you once more indeed it seems that I must do so

          
          31:14:25
          and that it's my fate to receive help from you where I least look for it and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil purpose so far you've deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly truly I say and mean he added with a glance at Sam for twice now we've been in your power and you've done no harm to us nor have you tried to take from me what you once sought May the third time prove the best but I warn you smeagle you are in danger yes yes master said Gollum Dreadful danger smee's Bon shake to

          
          31:15:05
          think of it but he doesn't run away he must help nice master I didn't mean the danger that we all share said froo I mean a danger to yourself alone you swore A Promise by what you call the precious remember that it'll hold you to it but it will seek a way to twist it to your own undoing already you're being Twisted you revealed yourself to me just now foolishly give it back to smeagle you said don't say that again don't let that thought grow in you you'll never get it back but the desire of it may betray you

          
          31:15:46
          to a Bitter End you'll never get it back in the last need smeagle I should put on the precious and the precious master you long ago if I wearing it were to command you you would obey even if it were to LEAP from a precipice or to cast yourself into the fire and such would be my command so have a care smeagle Sam looked at his master with approval but also with surprise there was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he hadn't known before it had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear Mr

          
          31:16:25
          Frodo was of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness of course he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr Frodo was the wisest person in the world with the possible exception of old Mr Bilbo and of Gandalf Gollum in his own way and with much more excuses his acquaintance was much briefer may have made a similar mistake confusing kindness and blindness at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him he groveled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice

          
          31:17:04
          M Frodo waited patiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly come now Gollum or smeagle if you wish tell me of this other way and show me if you can what hope there is in it enough to justify me in turning aside from my plain path I'm in haste but Gollum was in a pitiable state and Frodo's threat had quite unnerved him it wasn't easy to get any clear account out of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged them both to be kind to poor little SME girl

          
          31:17:44
          after a while he grew a little calmer and Frodo gathered bit by bit that if a traveler followed the road that turned west of elel duth he would come in time time to a Crossing in a circle of dark trees on the right a road went down to OS gillath and the bridges of the andwin in the middle the road went on southwards on on on said Gollum we never went that way but they say it goes a 100 leagues until you can see the great water that is never still there are lots of fishes there and big birds eat fishes

          
          31:18:24
          nice Birds but we never went there alas no we never had a chance and further still there are more lands they say but the yellow face is very hot there and there are seldom any clouds and the men are Fierce and have dark faces we don't want to see that land no said Frodo but don't Wander from your road what of the third turning oh yes oh yes there is a Third Way said Gollum that is the road to the left and once it begins to climb up up winding and climbing back towards the tall Shadows when it turns around the Black

          
          31:19:07
          Rock you'll see it suddenly you'll see it above you and you'll want to hide see it see it what will you see the old fortress very old very horrible now we used to hear Tales from the south when SME was young long ago oh yes we used to tell lots of tales in the evening sitting by the banks of the Great River in the willow lands when the river was younger [Music] too he began to weep and mutter the hobbits waited patiently tales of the South Gollum went on again about the tall men with The Shining eyes and their houses like hills

          
          31:19:52
          of stone and the silver crown of their King and his white tree wonderful Tales they built very tall towers and one they raised with silver white and in it there was a stone like the moon and round it were great white walls oh yes there were many tales about the Tower of the Moon that would be M ithil that isor the son of elendil built said Frodo it was isor who cut off the finger of the enemy yes he has only four on the black hand but they're enough said Gollum shuddering and he hated isor City what does he not hate said Frodo

          
          31:20:35
          but what has the Tower of the Moon to do with us well Master there it was and there it is the tall tower and the white houses in the wall but not nice now not beautiful he conquered it long ago it is a terrible place now Travelers shiver when they see it they creep out of sight they avoid its shadow but Master will have to go that way that is the only other way for the mountains are lower there and the old road goes up and up until it reaches a dark part at the top and then it goes down down again to

          
          31:21:17
          garoth his voice sank to a whisper and he shuted but how will that help us asked Sam surely the enemy knows all about his own mountains and that road will be guarded as close as this the tower isn't empty is it oh no not empty whispered Gollum it seems empty but it isn't oh no very Dreadful things live there Orcs yes always Orcs but worse things worse things live there too the road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and passes the gate nothing moves on the road that they don't know about the

          
          31:21:57
          things inside know the silent Watchers so that your advice is it said Sam that we should go another long march South to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one when we get there if we ever do no no indeed said Gollum Hobbits must see must try to understand he doesn't expect attack that way his eye is all round but it attends more to some places than to others he can't see everything all at once not yet you see he has conquered all the country west of the shadowy mountains down to the river

          
          31:22:38
          and he holds the bridges now he thinks no one can come to the moon tower without fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and he will know about you seem to know a lot about what he's doing and thinking said Sam have you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing with Orcs not nice hobit not sensible said Gollum giving Sam an angry glance and turning to Frodo smeel has talked to Orcs yes of course before he met master and to many peoples he has walked very far and what he says now

          
          31:23:19
          many people are saying it's here in the north that the big danger is for him and for us he will come out of the black gate one day one day soon that is the only way big armies can come but away down West he is not afraid and there are the silent Watchers just so said Sam not to be put off and so we're to walk up and knock at their gate and ask if we're on the right Road for Mordor or are they too silent to answer it's not sense we might as well do it here and save ourselves along don't make jokes about it his

          
          31:23:58
          Gollum it isn't funny oh no not amusing it's not sense to try and get into Mordor at all but if Master says I must go or I will go then he must try some way but he must not go to the terrible City oh no of course not that is where smeagle helps nice smeagle though no one tells him what it is all about smeagle helps again he found it he knows it what did he find asked Frodo Gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again a little path leading up into the mountains and then a stair a narrow

          
          31:24:43
          stair oh yes very long and narrow and then more stairs and then his voice sank even lower a tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cliff and the path high above the main pass it was that way that smeagle got out of the darkness but it was years ago the path may have vanished now but perhaps not perhaps not I don't like the sound of it at all said Sam sounds too easy at any rate in the telling if that path is still there it'll be guarded too wasn't it guarded Gollum as he said this he caught or

          
          31:25:27
          fancied he caught a green gleam in gollum's eye Gollum muttered but did not reply is it guarded asked Frodo sternly and did you escape out of the darkness Meagle were you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand that at least is what Aragorn thought who found you by the dead marshes some years ago it's a lie hissed Gollum and an evil light came into his eyes at the name of of Aragorn he lied on me yes he did I did Escape All by my poor self indeed I was told to seek for the precious and I have

          
          31:26:07
          searched and searched of course I have but not for the black one the precious was ours it was mine I tell you I did Escape rodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once not so far from the truth as might be suspected that he had somehow found a way out of Mordor and at least believed that it was by his own cunning for one thing he noted that Gollum used I and that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare appearances that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the

          
          31:26:45
          moment on top but even if Gollum could be trusted on this point froda didn't forget the Wilds of the enemy The Escape may have been allowed or arranged and well known in the Dark Tower and in any case Gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back I ask you again he said is not this secret way guarded but the name of Aragorn had put Gollum into a sullen mood he had all the injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth or part of it he didn't answer is it not guarded froda repeated

          
          31:27:23
          yes yes perhaps no safe places in this country said Gollum suly no safe places but Master must try it or go home no other way they couldn't get him to say more the name of the perilous place and the high pass he could not tell or would not its name was kirth unol a name of dreadful rumor Aragon could perhaps have told them that name and its significance Gandalf would have warned them but they were alone and Aragorn was far away and Gandalf stood amid the ruin of is and guard and strove with sadon delayed by

          
          31:28:05
          treason yet even as he spoke his last words to sadon and the Palante crashed in fire upon the Steeps of orun his mind was ever upon Frodo and Sam over the long leagues his mind sought for them in Hope and pity maybe Frodo felt it not knowing it as he had upon Armon hen even though he believed that Gandalf Was Gone Gone Forever into the shadow in Moria far away he sat upon the ground for a long while silent his head bowed striving to recall all that Gandalf had said to him but for this Choice he could recall no

          
          31:28:44
          counsel indeed Gandalf's guidance had been taken from them too soon too soon while the dark land was still very far away how they should enter it at the last Gandalf had not said perhaps he could not say into the stronghold of the enemy in the north into do gor he had once ventured but into Mordor to the Mountain of Fire and to bador since the Dark Lord rose in power again had he ever journeyed there Frodo didn't think so and here he was a little halfling from the sh a simple Hobbit of The Quiet

          
          31:29:23
          Countryside expected to find a way where the great ones could not go or dared not go it was an evil fate but he'd taken it on himself in his own sitting room in the far off Spring of another year so remote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the world's youth when the Trees of silver and gold were still in bloom this was an evil Choice which way should he choose and if both LED to Terror and death what good lay in choice the day Drew on a deep silence fell upon the little gray Hollow where they lay so

          
          31:30:03
          near to the borders of the land of fear a silence that could be felt as if it were a thick Veil that cut them off from all the world about them above them was a dome of pale Sky barred with fleeting smoke but it seemed high and far away as if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought not even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked The Hobbit sitting there under the weight of Doom Silent not moving shrouded in their thin gray cloaks for a moment he might have paused to consider golum a tiny figure

          
          31:30:42
          sprawling on the ground there perhaps lay the famished skeleton of some child of men its ragged garments still clinging to it its long arms and legs almost bone white and Bone thin no flesh worth a peck Frodo's head was bowed over his knees but Sam leaned back with hands behind his head staring out of his hood at the empty sky at least for a long while it was empty then presently Sam thought he saw a dark birdlike figure wheel into the circle of his sight and hover and then wheel away again two more followed and

          
          31:31:20
          then a fourth they were very small to look at yet he knew knew somehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of pinion flying at a great height he covered his eyes and bent forward cowering the same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of the Black Riders the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind and the shadow on the moon though now it was not so crushing or compelling the Menace was more remote but Menace it was Frodo felt it too his thought was broken he stirred and

          
          31:31:57
          shivered but he didn't look up Gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider the winged shapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeding back to Mordor Sam took a deep breath the Riders are about again up in the air he said in a horse whisper I saw them do you think they could see us they were very high up and if they're Black Riders same as before then they can't see much by daylight can they no perhaps not said Frodo but their steeds could see and these winged creatures that they ride on now they can probably see more

          
          31:32:40
          than any other creature they are like great caran birds they're looking for something the enemy is on the watch I fear the feeling of dread passed but the unfolding silence was broken for some time they had been cut off from the world as if in an invisible Island now they were laid bear again Peril had returned but still Frodo did not speak to Gollum or make his choice his eyes were closed as if he were dreaming or looking inward into his heart and memory at last he stirred and stood up and it seemed that he was about

          
          31:33:19
          to speak and to aside but hark he said what's that a NE fear was upon them they heard singing and horse shouting at first it seemed a long way off but it drew nearer it was coming towards them it leapt into all their minds that the black wings had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize them no speed seemed too great for these terrible Servants of Sauron they crouched listening the voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close Frodo and Sam loosened their small swords in their sheathes flight

          
          31:33:58
          was impossible Gollum Rose slowly and crawled insect likee to the lip of the hollow very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch until he could peer over it between two broken points of stone he remained there without moving for some time making no sound presently the voices began to recede again and then they slowly faded away far off a horn blew on the ramp parts of the then quietly Gollum Drew back and slipped down into the hollow more men going to moror he said in a low voice dark faces we've not seen

          
          31:34:40
          men like these before no smeagle hasn't they're fierce they have black eyes and long black hair and gold rings in their ears yes lots of beautiful gold and some have red paint on their cheek cheeks and red cloaks and their flags are red and the tips of their Spears and they have round Shields yellow and black with big spikes not nice very cruel wicked men they look almost as bad as Orcs And much bigger smeagle thinks they have come out of the South beyond the great River's End they came up that road they have

          
          31:35:18
          passed on to the black gate but more may follow always more people coming to to modor one day all the peoples will be inside were there any olifants asked Sam forgetting his fear and his eagerness for news of strange places no no olifants what are oonts said colum Sam stood up putting his hands behind his back as he always did when speaking poetry and began gray as a mouse big as a house nose like a snake I make the Earth shake as I through the grass trees crack as I pass with horns in my mouth I walk

          
          31:36:02
          in the South flapping big ears Beyond count of years I stump round and round never lie on the ground not even to die o font am I biggest of all huge old and Tall if ever you'd met me you wouldn't forget me if you never do you won't think I'm true but oh old olifant am I and I never lie that said Sam when he' finished reciting that's a Ry we have in the sh nonsense maybe and maybe not but we have our Tales too and news of the South you know in the old days Hobbits used to go on their travels now and

          
          31:36:43
          again not that many ever came back and not that all they said was believed news from brie and not sure as sh talk as the says go but I've heard tales of the big folk down way in the sunlands stings we call them in our tales and they ride on olifant is said when they fight they put houses and Towers on the ol's backs and all and the olifants throw rocks and trees at one another so when you say men out of the South all in red and gold I said were there any olant for if there was I was going to take a look risk or

          
          31:37:22
          no but now I don't suppose I'll ever see an olifant maybe there ain't no such Beast he sighed no no olant said Gollum again smeagle hasn't heard of them he doesn't want to see them he doesn't want them to be smeel wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer smeel wants Master to go nice master won't it come with smeagle Frodo stood up he' laughed in the midst of all his cares when Sam trotted out the old Fireside rhyme of olant and the laugh had released him from hesitation I wish we had a thousand

          
          31:38:05
          olifants with gandal on a white one at their head he said then we'd break away into this evil land perhaps but we've not just our own tired legs that's all well smeagle the third turn may turn the best I will come with you good good Master wise Master nice master said Gollum in Delight patting Frodo's knees good Master then rest now nice Hobbits under the shadow of the stones close under the stones rest and lie quiet till the yellow face goes away then we can go quickly soft and quick as Shadows we

          
          31:38:50
          must be chapter 4 of herbs and Steed rabbit for the few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting into the shade as the Sun moved until at last the shadow of the western rim of their Dell grew long and darkness filled all the hollow then they ate a little and drank sparingly Gollum ate nothing but he accept water gladly soon get more now he said licking his lips good water runs down in streams to the Great River nice water in the lands we're going to smeel will get food there too perhaps he's very hungry yes

          
          31:39:46
          col he set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly and a pale green light came into his eyes The Dusk was deep when at length they set out creeping over the westward rim of the dell and fading like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road the moon was now three nights from the full but it didn't climb over the mountains until nearly midnight and the early night was very dark a single red light burned high up in the towers of the teeth but otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on

          
          31:40:24
          the Moran for many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled stumbling through a baren Stony country they didn't dare to take the road but they kept it on their left following its line as well as they could at a little distance at last when night was growing old and they were already weary for they had taken only one short rest the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then vanished they'd turned to the dark Northern shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards with hearts strangely

          
          31:41:04
          lightened they now rested again but not for long they were not going quick enough for Gollum by his Reckoning it was nearly 30 leagues from the Moran to the crossroads above OS gillath and he hoped to cover that distance in four Journeys so soon they struggled on once more until the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide gray Solitude they then walked almost 8 leagues and the hobbits could not have gone any further even if they dared the growing light revealed to them a land already less Barren and

          
          31:41:41
          ruinous the mountains still loomed up ominously on their left but near at hand they could see the Southward road now bearing away from the black roots of the hills and slating westwards Beyond it were slopes covered with somber trees like dark clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grown with Ling and broom and Cornell and other shrubs that they didn't know here and there they saw knots of Tall Pine trees the hearts of the hobbits rose again a little in spite of weird the air was fresh and fragrant and it reminded

          
          31:42:18
          them of the Uplands of the north faring far away it seemed good to be reprieved to walk in a land that had only been for a few years under the Dominion of the dark lord and wasn't yet Fallen holy into Decay but they didn't forget their danger nor the black gate that was still all too near hidden though it was behind the gloomy Heights they looked about for a hiding place where they could Shelter From Evil Eyes while the light lasted the day passed uneasily they lay deep in the Heather and countered out the slow hours in

          
          31:42:55
          which there seemed little change for they were still under the shadows of the eel duath and the sun was veiled Frodo slept at times deeply and peacefully either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble about him but Sam found it difficult to do more than do even when Gollum was plainly fast asleep whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams hunger perhaps more than mistrust kept him wakeful he had begun to long for a good homely meal something hot out of the pot as soon as the land faded into a

          
          31:43:35
          formless gray under coming night they started out again in a little while Gollum LED them down onto the Southward Road and after that they went on more quickly though the danger was greater their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the road ahead or following them from behind but the night passed and they heard no sound of Walker or Rider the road had been made in a long lost time and for perhaps 30 M below the it had been newly repaired but as it went South the wild encroached upon

          
          31:44:14
          it the handiwork of men of old could still be seen in its straight sure flight and level course now and again it cut its way through Hillside slopes or leapt over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring masonry but at last all signs of stonework faded save for a broken pillar here and there peering out of bushes at the side or old paving stones still lurking amid weeds and Moss Heather and trees and breens scrambled down and overhung the banks or sprawled out over the surface it dwindled at last to a country

          
          31:44:54
          Cart Road little used but it didn't wind it held on its own Shore course and guided them by the swiftest way so they passed into the northern marches of that land that men once called ethilon a fair country of climbing woods and Swift falling streams the night became fine under star and Round Moon and it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward and and from the blowing and muttering of Gollum it seemed that he noticed it too and didn't relish it at the first signs of day they

          
          31:45:31
          halted again they'd come to the end of a long cutting deep and sheer sighted in the middle by which the road clove its way through a Stony Ridge now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad day was opening in the sky and they saw that the mountains were now much further off off receding Eastward in a long curve that was lost in the distance before them as they turned West gentle slopes run down into dim hazes far below all about them were small Woods of resinous trees fur and Cedar and Cyprus

          
          31:46:11
          and other kinds unknown in the Sha with wide Glades among them and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet smelling herbs and shrubs the long journey from rivendel had brought them far south of their own land but not until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of climb here spring was already busy about them thrs pierced moss and bold larches were green fingered small flowers were opening in the turf birds were singing ethelon The Garden of Gondor now desolate kept still a disheveled dried

          
          31:46:51
          loveliness South and West it looked towards the warm lower veils of andwin shielded from the east by the eldath and yet not under the Mountain Shadow protected from the north by the eming wheel open to the southern airs and the moist winds from the sea far away many great trees grew there planted long ago falling into untended age amid a riot of careless descendants and Groves and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terbin of Olive and a bay and they were junipers and myrtles and thyes that grew in bushes or with

          
          31:47:31
          their Woody creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden Stones sages of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or pale green and mams and new sprouting parsleys and many herbs of forms and scents Beyond The Garden Lord of Sam the grots and Rocky walls were already starred with sexif Bridges and stone crops primals and anemones were awake in the filbert breaks and as Fidel and many lily flowers nodded their half opened heads in the grass deep green grass beside the pools where falling

          
          31:48:08
          streams halted in cool Hollows on their Journey Down To andwin The Travelers turned their backs on the road and went downhill as they walked brushing their way through Bush and Herb sweet odors Rose about them Gollum coughed and wretched but the hobbits breathed deep and suddenly Sam laughed for heart's ease not for Gest they followed a stream that went quickly down before them presently it brought them to a small Clear Lake in a shallow Dell it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone Basin the carvon rim of

          
          31:48:48
          which was almost wholly covered with mosses and Rose brambles Iris swords stood in ranks about it and water lily leaves floated on its dark gently Rippling surface but it was deep and fresh and Spilled ever softly out over a Stony lip at the far end here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the infalling freshet then they sought for a resting place and a hiding place for this land Fair seeming still was nonetheless now territory of the enemy they'd not come very far from the road and yet even in so short a space

          
          31:49:30
          they'd seen scars of the old Wars and the newer wounds made by the Orcs and other foul Servants of the dark lord a pit of uncovered filth and refu trees heed down wly and left to die with evil runes or the Fel sign of the eye cut in rude Strokes on their bark Sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake smelling and touching the unfamiliar plants and trees forgetful for the moment of Mordor was reminded suddenly of their everpresent Peril he stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire and in the midst of it

          
          31:50:08
          he found a pile of charred and broken bones and skulls the Swift growth of the wild with Bri and eglantine and trailing Cletus was already drawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and Slaughter but it wasn't ancient he huded back to his companions but he said nothing the bones were best left in peace and not poured and routed by Gollum let's find a place to lie up in he said not lower down higher up for me a little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last year's Fern Beyond it was a Thicket of dark

          
          31:50:49
          leaved Bay trees climbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old Cedars here they decided to rest and pass the day which already promised to be bright and warm a good day for strolling on their way along the Groves and Glades of ethelon but though Orcs May shun the sunlight there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were abroad saon had many servants Gollum in any case wouldn't move under the yellow face soon it would look over the dark Ridges of the elel doth and he would

          
          31:51:28
          faint and cower in the light and heat Sam had been giving Earnest thought to food as they marched now that the despair of the impossible gate was behind him he didn't feel so inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their errand and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread of the elves for worst times ahead six days or more had passed since he reckoned that they had only a bare supply for 3 weeks if we reach the fire in that time we'll be lucky at this rate he thought

          
          31:52:05
          and we might be wanting to get back we might besides at the end of a long night March and after bathing and drinking he felt even more hungry than usual a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted an idea struck him and he turned to Gollum Gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern hi Gollum said Sam where are you going hunting well see here old noser you don't like our food and I'd not be

          
          31:52:45
          sorry for a change myself your new motto always ready to help could you find anything for a hungry Hobbit yes perhaps yes said Gollum SME will always helps if they asks if they asks nicely Right Said Sam I does ask and if that isn't nice enough I begs Gollum disappeared he was away sometime and Frodo after a few mouthfuls of lmas settled deep into the brown Fern and went to sleep Sam looked at him the early daylight was only just creeping down into the Shadows under the trees but he saw his Master's face very

          
          31:53:35
          clearly and His Hands too lying at rest on the ground beside him he was reminded suddenly of Frodo as he'd lay asleep in the house of ilon after his deadly wound then as he'd kept Watch Sam had noticed not that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within but now the light was even clearer and stronger Frodo's face was peaceful the marks of fear and Care had left it but it looked old old and beautiful as if the chiseling of the shaping ears was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden though the identity

          
          31:54:17
          of the face was not changed not that Sam gamji put it that way to himself he shook his head as if finding words useless and murmured I love him he's like that and sometimes it shines through somehow but I love him whether or no Gollum returned quietly and peered over Sam's shoulder looking at Frodo he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound Sam came to him a moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself on the ground beside him lay two small rabbits which he was beginning to eye

          
          31:54:59
          greedily smigle always helps he said he's brought rabbits nice rabbits but master has gone to sleep and perhaps Sam wants to sleep doesn't want rabbits now smeagle tries to help but he can't catch things all in a minute Sam however had no objection to Rabbit at all and said so at least not to cook rabbits all Hobbits of course can cook for they begin to learn the art before their letters which many never reach but Sam was a good cook even by Hobbit Reckoning and he'd done a good deal of the camp cooking on their

          
          31:55:41
          travels when there was a chance he still hopefully carried some of his gear and his pack a small Tinder Box two small shallow pans the smaller fitting into the larger inside them a wooden spoon a short two pronged fork and some skewers were stowed and hidden at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure some salt but he needed a fire and other things besides he thought for a bit while he took out his knife cleaned and wetted it and began to dress the rabbits he wasn't going to leave Frodo

          
          31:56:18
          alone asleep even for a few minutes now Gollum he said I have another job for you go and fill these pans with water and bring her back smel will fetch water yes said Gollum but what does The Hobbit want all that water for he's drunk he's washed never you mind said Sam if you can't guess you'll soon find out and the sooner you fetch the water the sooner you'll learn don't you damage one of my pans or I'll carve you into minc meat while Gollum was away Sam took another look at Frodo he was still sleeping

          
          31:56:58
          quietly but Sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands too thin and drawn he is he muttered not right for a hobbit if I can get these conies cooked I'm going to wake him up Sam gathered a pile of the driest Fern and then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood the Fallen br bunch of a cedar at the top gave him a good Supply he cut out some turves at the foot of the bank just outside the fern breake and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in it being handy with flint and Tinder he

          
          31:57:36
          soon had a small Blaze going it made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent he was just stooping over his fire shielding it and building it up with heavier wood when Gollum returned cting the pans carefully and grumbling to himself he set the pans down and then suddenly saw what Sam was doing he gave a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frightened and angry a sh no he cried no silly Hobbits foolish yes foolish they mustn't do it mustn't do what asked samon surprise not make the nasty red tongues his scum f fire

          
          31:58:23
          fire it's dangerous yes it is it burns it kills and it will bring enemies yes it will I don't think so said Sam don't see why it should if you don't put wet stuff on it and make a smother but if it does it does I'm going to risk it anyhow I'm going to steal these conies the rabbits squealed Gollum in dismay spoil beautiful me smeagle safe for you poor hungry smeagle what for what for silly Hobbit they're young they're tender they're nice eat them eat them he clawed at the nearest rabbit already skinned and lying by the fire

          
          31:59:11
          now now said Sam each to his own fashion our bread chokes you and raw Coney chokes me if you give me a Coney the cone's mine see to cook if I have a mind and I have you needn't watch me go and catch another and eat it as your fancy somewhere private and out of my sight then you won't see the fire and I sh see you and we'll both be the happier I'll see the fire don't smoke if that's any comfort to you Gollum withdrew grumbling and crawled into the fern Sam busied himself with his pans what a hobbit needs with Cony he

          
          31:59:52
          said said to himself is some herbs and Roots especially tiers not to mention bread herbs we can manage seemingly colum he called softly third time pays for all I want some herbs gollum's head peeped out of the fern but his looks were neither helpful nor friendly a few bay leaves some time and Sage will do before the water boils said Sam no said Gollum smeagle is not pleased and smeagle doesn't like smelly leaves he doesn't eat grasses or Roots no precious not till he's starving or very sick poor

          
          32:00:37
          smeagle smeagle will get into real true hot water when this water boils if he don't do as he's asked growled Sam Sam will put his head in it Yes precious and I'll make him look for turnips and carrots and ters too if if it was the time of the year I'll bet there's all sorts of good things running wild in this country I'd give a lot for half a dozen ters smeel won't go oh no precious not this time he scum he's frightened and he's well tired and this Hobbit's not nice not nice at all smeagle won't

          
          32:01:14
          grab for roots and carrot and tits what's tiers precious eh what's tits but tight toes said Sam the gaffer's delight and rare good balast for an empty belly but you won't find any so you needn't look but be good smeagle and fetch me the herbs and I'll think better of you what's more if you turn over a new leaf and keep it turned I'll cook you some Tes one of these days I will fried fish and chips served by S gamji you couldn't say no to that yes yes we could SP o nice fish scorching it give me fish now and keep nasty chips oh

          
          32:02:00
          you're hopeless said Sam go to sleep in the end he had to find what he wanted for himself but he didn't have to go far not out of sight of the place where his master lay still sleeping for a while Sam sat musing and tending the far till the water boiled the daylight light grew and the air became warm the Dew faded off Turf and leaf soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with a bunched herbs almost Sam fell asleep as the time went by he let them Ste for close on an hour testing them now and again with his

          
          32:02:39
          fork and tasting the broth when he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the far and crept along to Frodo Frodo half opened his eyes as Sam stood over him and then he wakened from his dreaming another gentle unrecoverable dream of Peace hello Sam he said not resting is anything wrong what's the time about a couple of hours after Daybreak said Sam a n on half 8 by sh clocks maybe but nothing's wrong though it ain't quite what I'd call right no stock no onions no ters I've got a bit of stew for you and some broth Mr Frodo

          
          32:03:25
          do you good you'll have to sap it in your mug or straight from the pan when it's cooled a bit I haven't brought no balls nor nothing proper Frodo yawned and stretched you should have been resting Sam he said and lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts but I do feel hungry can I smell it from here what have you stewed a present from smeagle said Sam a brace of young conies though I fancy gollum's regretting them now but there's not to go with them but a few herbs Sam and his master sat down within

          
          32:04:03
          the fern break and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old Fork and Spoon they allowed themselves half a piece of the Elish way bread each it seemed a feast we Callum Sam called and whistled softly come on still time to change your mind there's some left if you want to try some stewed Cony there was no answer oh well I suppose he's gone off to find something for himself we'll finish it said Sam and then you must take some sleep said Frodo don't you drop off while I'm nodding Mr Frodo I don't feel too sure

          
          32:04:41
          of him there's a good deal of stinker the bad Gollum if you understand me and him still and it's getting stronger again not but what I think he'd try to throttle me first now we don't see eye to eye and he's not pleased with Sam oh no precious not pleased at all they finished and Sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear as he stood up to return he looked back to the slope at that moment he saw the sun rise out of the reeks or Haze or dark shadow or whatever it was that lay ever to the East and it sent its golden beams down

          
          32:05:21
          upon the tree and Glades about him then he noticed a thin spiral of blue gray smoke plain to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a Thicket above him with a shock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking fire which he'd neglected to put out that won't do never thought it would show like that he muttered and he started to hurry back suddenly he halted and listened had he heard a whistle or not or was it the call of some strange bird if it was a whistle it didn't come from Frodo's Direction there it went

          
          32:06:02
          again from another place Sam began to run as well as he could uphill he found that a small brand burning away to its outer end had kindled some Fern at the edge of the fire and the fern blazing up had set the turb smoldering hastily he Stamped Out what was left of the fire scattering the ashes and laid the turs on the hole then he crept back to Frodo did you hear a whistle and what sounded like an answer he asked a few minutes back I hope it was only a bird but it didn't sound quite like that more

          
          32:06:39
          like somebody mimicking a bird call I thought and I'm afraid my bit of fire has been smoking now if I've gone and brought trouble I'll never forgive myself nor won't have a chance may be hush whispered Frodo I thought I heard voices the two Hobbits trusted their small packs put them on ready for flight and then crawled deeper into the fern there they crouched listening there was no doubt of the voices they were speaking low and furtively but they were near and coming nearer then quite suddenly one spoke

          
          32:07:19
          clearly close at hand here here's where the smoke came from it's it will be n at hand in the fern no doubt we shall have it like a Cony in a trap then we shall learn what kind of thing it is I and what it knows said a second voice at once four men came striding through the fern from different directions since flight and hiding were no longer possible Frodo and Sam sprang to their feet putting back to back and whipping out their small swords if they were astonished at what they saw their capto were even more

          
          32:08:01
          astonished four tall men stood there two had Spears in their hands with broad bright heads two had great bows almost of their own height and great Quivers of long green feathered arrows all had swords at their sides and were clad in green and brown of varied Hues as if they're better to walk unseen in The Glades of Vilan green gauntlets covered their hands and their faces were hooded and masked with green except for their eyes which were very keen and bright at once Frodo thought of Boromir for these

          
          32:08:35
          men were like him in stature and bearing and in their manner of speech we have not found what we sought said one but what have we found not Orcs said another releasing the hilt of his sword which he had seized when he saw the the glitter of Sting in Frodo's hand elves said a third doubtfully nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as it appeared the chief among them elves don't walk in ailon in these days and elves are wondrous fair to look upon or so to said meaning where not I take it said Sam thank you kindly and when you

          
          32:09:16
          finish discussing us perhaps you'll say who you are and why you can't let two tired travel has rest the tall green man laughed grimly I am farer captain of gondo he said but there are no Travelers in this land only the Servants of The Dark Tower or of the white but we're neither said rodo and travelers we are whatever Captain fatmir may say then make haste to declare yourselves on your errand said faramir we have a work to do and this is no time or place for riddling or paring come where's the third of your company the

          
          32:09:57
          third yes the skullking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool Down Yonder he had an ill favored look some spying breed of orc I guess or a creature of theirs but he gave us the slip by some Fox trick I don't know where he is said Frodo he's only a chance companion met upon the road and I'm not answerable for him if you come on him spare him bring him or send him to us he's only a rich wretched Gangrel creature but I have him under my care for a while but as for us we are Hobbits of the Sha far to the

          
          32:10:34
          north and west Beyond many rivers Frodo son of Drogo is my name and with me is Sam wiise son of hamast a worthy Hobbit in my service we have come by long ways out of rivendel or imladris as some call it here ad started and grew intent Seven Companions we had one we lost at Moria the others we left at PA Garin above Ros two of my kin a dwarf there was also and an elf and two men they were Aragorn and Boromir who said that he came out of Min tith a city in the South Boromir all the four men exclaimed bmir son of the Lord denior

          
          32:11:19
          said faramir and strange stern look came into his face you came with him that's news indeed if it be true no little strangers that bmir son of denior was high Warden of the White Tower and our captain General sorely do we miss him who are you then and what are you to do with him be swift for the sun is climbing are the riddling words known to you that bmir brought to rivendel froda replied seek for the sword that was broken in imladris it dwells the words are known indeed said phir in astonishment

          
          32:11:58
          it is some token of your truth that you also know them Aragorn whom I named is the bearer of the sword that was broken said Frodo and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of that I see said faramir thoughtfully oh I see that it might be so and what is islor's banee that is hidden answered Frodo doubtless it will be made clear in time we must learn more of this said faramir and know what brings you so far east under the shadow of Yonder he pointed and said no name but not now we have business in hand you are in Peril and he

          
          32:12:40
          would not have gone far by field or Road this day there will be hard handres nigh at hand there the day is full then death or Swift flight back to andwin I will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine wise men trusts not to chance meeting on the road in this land if I turn I'll speak more with you farewell said Frodo bowing low think what you will I am a friend of all enemies of the one enemy we would go with you if we halfling folk could hope to serve you such Dy men and strong as you seem and

          
          32:13:16
          if my errand permitted it may the light shine on your swords the halflings are courtes folk whatever else they be said fatmir farewell The Hobbit sat down again but they said nothing to one another of their thoughts and doubts close by just under the dappling shadow of the dark Bay trees two men remained on guard they took off their masks now and again to cool them as the day heat grew and Frodo saw that they were goodly men pale skinned dark of hair with gray eyes and faces sad and proud they spoke together

          
          32:13:55
          in soft voices at first using the common speech but after the manner of older days and then changing to another language of their own to his amazement as he listened froda became aware that it was the Elven tongue that they spoke or one but little different and he looked at them with Wonder for he knew then that they must be dunad of the South men of the line of the Lords of westernness after a while he spoke to them but they were slow and cautious in answering they named themselves mablung and damrod

          
          32:14:30
          soldiers of Gondor and they were Rangers of aelan for they were descended from folk who lived in ethelon at one time before it was overrun from such men the Lord denior chose His Four HS who crossed the unon secretly how or where they would not say to Harry the Orcs and other enemies that roamed between the effel DU and the river it is close on 10 leagues hence to the east shore of andwin said mablung and we seldom come so far a field but we have a new errand on this journey we come to Ambush the men of harad curse

          
          32:15:06
          them I curse the South runs said damrod it is said that there were dealings of old between Gondor and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south though there was never friendship in those days our bounds were away South beyond the mouths of andwin and umbar the nearest of their Realms acknowledged our sway but that is long since is's many lives of men since any pass two or fro between us now of late we've learned that the enemy has been among them and they are gone over to him or back to him they were ever

          
          32:15:43
          ready to his will as have so many also in the East I doubt not that the days of Gondor unnumbered and and the walls of minth are doomed so great is his strength and Malice but still we will not sit Idol and let him do all as he would said mablung these cursed Sans come now marching up the ancient roads to swell the hosts of The Dark Tower yay up the very roads that craft of Gondor made and they go ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that the power of their new master is great enough so that the mere

          
          32:16:19
          shadow of his Hills will protect them we come to teach them another lesson great strength of them was reported to us some days ago marching North one of their regiments is due by our Reckoning to pass by sometime in noon up on the road above where it passes through the cloven way the road may pass but they shall not not while faramir is Captain he leads now in all perilous Ventures but his life is Charmed or fate spares him for some other end their talk died down into a listening silence all seemed still and

          
          32:16:58
          watchful Sam crouched by the edge of the fern break peered out with his Keen Hobbit eyes he saw that many more men were about he could see them stealing up the slopes singly or in Long files keeping always to the shade of Grove or Thicket or crawling hardly visible in their brown and green rment through grass and a break all were were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their hands and were armed like fimir and his companions before long they had all passed and vanished the sun rose till it neared the South the Shadows

          
          32:17:35
          shrank I wonder where that dratted Gollum is thought Sam as he crawled back into Deeper Shade he stands a fair chance of being spitted for an orc or of being roasted by the yellow face but I fancy he'll look after himself he lay down beside Frodo and began to doze he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing he sat up it was now High Noon the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees suddenly the horns rang out louder and Beyond mistake from above over the top of the slope Sam thought that he

          
          32:18:15
          heard cries and wild shouting also but the sound was faint as if it came out of some distant cave C then presently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand just above their hiding place he could here plainly the ringing grate of Steel on steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull beat of blade on Shield men were yelling and screaming and one clear loud voice was calling Gondor Gondor it sounds like a 100 blacksmiths all smiing together said Sam to Frodo be as near as I I want them now but the

          
          32:18:53
          noise grew closer they're coming cried damrod see some of the souths are broken from the trap and are flying from the road there they go our men after them and the captain leading Sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay trees for a moment he caught a glimpse of swy men in red running down the slope some way off with green clad Warriors leaping off after them hewing them down as they fled arrows were thick in the air then

          
          32:19:26
          suddenly straight over the rim of their Sheltering Bank a man fell crashing through the Slender trees nearly on top of them he came to rest in the fern a few feet away faced downward Green Arrow feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar his Scarlet robes were tattered his corselet of overlapping Brazen plates was rent and heun his black plats of hair braided with gold were drenched with blood his Brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword it was Sam's first view of a battle of men against men and he did not

          
          32:19:59
          like it much he was glad that he could not see the Dead face he wondered what the man's name was and where he came from and if he was really evil at heart or what lies or threats had led him on the Long March from his home and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace all in a flash of thought which was quickly driven from his mind for just as mablung stepped towards the Fallen body there was a new noise great crying and shouting amidst it Sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting and

          
          32:20:32
          then a great thudding and bumping like huge Rams dinning on the ground where where cried damrod to His companion May the Val turn him aside mumar mumar to his astonishment and Terror and Lasting Delight said saw a vast shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope big as a house much bigger than a house it looked to him a gray clad moving Hill fear and Wonder Maybe enlarged him in the hobbit's eyes but the moark of harded was indeed a beast of vast bulk and the like of him does not walk now in Middle

          
          32:21:11
          Earth his kin that lives still in latter days are but memories of his girth and Majesty on he came straight towards the Watchers and then swerved aside in the nick of time passing only a few yards away rocking the ground beneath their feet his great legs like trees enormous sail like ears spread out long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to strike his small red eyes raging his upturned horn-like tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripping with blood his trappings of scarlet and gold

          
          32:21:47
          flapped about him in Wild tatters the ruins of what seemed a very War Tower lay upon his heaving back smashed in his Furious Passage through the woods and high upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure the body of a mighty warrior a giant among the squirtings on the great beast thundered blundering in blind WTH through pool and Thicket arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks men of both sides fled before him but many overtook and crushed to the ground soon he was lost to view still

          
          32:22:25
          trumpeting and stamping far away what became of him Sam never heard whether he escaped to Rome the wild for a time until he perished far from his home or was trapped in some deep pit or whether he raged on until he plunged in the Great River and was swallowed up Sam drew a deep breath an all f it was he said so there are oants and I've seen one what a life but no one at home will ever believe me well if that's over I'll have a bit of sleep sleep while you may said mablung but the captain will return if he's un

          
          32:23:09
          hurt and when he comes we shall depart swiftly we shall be pursued as soon as news of our deed reaches the enemy and that will not be long go quietly when you must said Sam no need to disturb my sleep I was walking all night mablo laughed I don't think the captain will leave you here Master Sam wise he said but you shall see chapter 5 the window on the west it seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke to find that it was late afternoon and faramir had come back he had brought many men with him

          
          32:23:57
          indeed all the survivors of the for were now gathered on the slope nearby two or 300 strong they sat in a wide semicircle between the arms of which faramir was Seated on the ground whilst Frodo stood before him it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner Sam crept out from the fern but no one paid any attention to him and he placed himself at the end of the rows of men where he could see and hear all that was going on he watched and listened intently ready to dash to his master's Aid if needed he could see faramir's

          
          32:24:33
          face which was now unmasked it was Stern and commanding and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance doubt was in the gray eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo Sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied with Frodo's account of himself at s several points what part he had to play in the company that set out from Rivendell why he had left bmir and where he was now going in particular he returned often to islor's Bane plainly he saw that thodo was concealing from him some matter of great

          
          32:25:10
          importance but it was at the coming of the halfling that Isel War's ban should waken or so one must read the words he insisted if then you're the halfling that was named doubtless you brought this thing whatever it may be to the Council of which you speak and there Boromir saw it do you deny it Frodo made no answer so said faramir I wish then to learn from you more of it for what concerns Boromir concerns me an orc Arrow slow isor so far as old Tales tell but orc arrows are plenty and the sight

          
          32:25:47
          of one would not be taken as a sign of Doom by bmir of Gondor had you this thing in keeping it is hidden you say but is not that because you choose to hide it no not because I choose answered Frodo it does not belong to me it does not belong to any mortal great or small though if any would claim it it would be Aragorn son of arthorn whom I named the leader of our company from Moria to raros why so and not Boromir Prince of the City that the sons of alil founded because Aragon is descended in direct lineage father to father from

          
          32:26:27
          isor Al lendel son himself and the sword that he Bears was elendel sword a murmur of astonishment ran through all the Ring of men some cried aloud the sword of alil the sword of alil comes to minister tith great Tidings but faramir's face was unmoved maybe he said but so great a claim will need to be established and clear proofs will be required should this Aragon ever come to minister tith he had not come nor any of your company when I set out 6 days ago bamir was satisfied of that claim said froo indeed

          
          32:27:08
          if bomy were here he would answer all your questions and since he was already at Ros many days back and intended then to go straight to your city if you return you may soon learn the answers there my part in the company was known to him as to all the others for it was appointed to me by Eland of imis himself before the whole Council on that errand I came into this country but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the company yet those who claimed to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder it Frodo's

          
          32:27:43
          tone was proud whatever he felt and Sam approved of it but it did not appease faramir so he said you bid me mind my own Affairs and get me back home and let you be bmir will tell all when he comes when he comes say you will you friend of bmir vividly before Frodo's mind came the memory of boromir's assault upon him and for a moment he hesitated faramir's eyes watching him grew harder bmir was a valiant member of our company said Frodo at length yes I was his friend for my part fatmir smiled grimly then you would grieve to learn

          
          32:28:27
          that bmir is dead I would grieve indeed said Frodo then catching the look in faramir's eyes he faled dead he said do you mean that he is dead and that you knew it you've been trying to trap me in words playing with me or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood I would not snare even an orc with a falsehood said faramir how then did he die and how do you know of it since you say that none of the company had reached the city when you left as to the manner of his death I had hoped that his friend and companion

          
          32:29:06
          would tell me how it was but he was alive and strong when we parted and he lives still for all that I know though surely there are many perils in the world many indeed said faramir and and treachery not the least Sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation these last words were more than he could bear and bursting into the middle of the Ring he strolled up to his master's side begging your pardon Mr Frodo he said but this has gone on long enough he's no right to talk to you so after

          
          32:29:44
          all you've been through as much for his good and for all these great men as for anyone else see here Captain he planted himself squarely in front of phir his hands on his hips and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young Hobbit who had offered him what he called Source when questioned about visits to the orchard there was some murmuring but also some grins on the faces of the men looking on the sight of their Captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with a young Hobbit legs well apart bristling with

          
          32:30:18
          wroth was one beyond their experience see here he said what are you driving at let's come to the point before all the Orcs of Mordor come down on us if you think my master murdered this barir and then ran away you've got no sense but say it and I've done and then let us know what you mean to do about it but it's a Pity that folk us talk about fighting the enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without interfering he'd be Mighty pleased if he could see you now now think he got a new friend he would

          
          32:30:54
          patience said phir but without anger do not speak before your master whose wit is greater than yours and I do not need any to teach me of our Peril even so I spare a brief time in order to judge justly in a hard matter were I as Hasty as you I might have slain you long ago for I am commanded to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of the Lord of Gondor but I do not slay man or beast needlessly and not gladly even when it is needed neither do I talk in vain so be comforted sit by your master and be

          
          32:31:36
          silent Sam sat down heavily with a red face faramir turned to Frodo again you asked how do I know that the son of denior is dead Tidings of death of many wings night of brings news to near Kindred they said bmir was my brother a shadow of Sorrow passed over his face do you remember ought of special Mark that the Lord bmir bore with him among his gear froda thought for a moment fearing some further trap and wondering how this debate would turn in the end he had hardly saved the ring from the proud

          
          32:32:14
          grasp of balmir and how he would fear now among so many men warlike and strong wrong he did not know yet he felt in his heart that faramir though he was much like his brother in looks was a man less self-regarding both Sterner and wiser I remember that bmir bore a horn he said at last you remember well and as one who has in truth seen him said fmir then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye a Great Horn of the wild oxs of the east bound with silver and written with ancient characters that horn the eldest son of

          
          32:32:54
          our house has borne for many generations and it is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of Gondor as the realm was of old its voice will not pass unheeded 5 days a I set out on this adventure 11 days ago at about this hour of the day I heard the blowing of that horn from the northward it seemed but dim as if it were but an echo in the mind a boding of ill we thought it my father and I for no Tidings had we heard of bmir since he went away and no Watcher on our borders had seen him

          
          32:33:30
          pass and on the third night after another and a stranger thing befell me I sat at Night By the Waters of anduin in the gray dark under the young Pale Moon watching the ever moving stream and the sad reads were rustling so do we ever watch the shore was NEOS gillath which our enemies now partly hold and issue from it to Harry our lands but that night all the world slept at the Midnight Hour then I saw or it seemed that I saw a boat floating on the water glimmering gray a small boat of a strong fashion with a high prow and there was

          
          32:34:10
          none to row or steer it an O fell on me for a pale light was round it but I Rose and went to the bank and began to walk out out into the stream for I was drawn towards it then the boat turned towards me and stayed its pace and floated Slowly by within my hands reach yet I Dar not handle it it wed deep as if it were heavily burdened and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze that it was almost filled with clear water from which came the light and Leed in the water a warrior lay asleep a broken sword was on his knee I saw

          
          32:34:54
          many wounds on him it was Boromir my brother dead I knew his gear his sword his beloved face one thing only I missed his horn one thing only I knew not a fair belt as it were of linked Golden Leaves about his waist B me I cried where is thy horn with the goest thou o Boromir but he was gone the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night dream like it was and yet no dream for there was no waking and I do not doubt that he is dead and has passed down the river to the Sea alas said

          
          32:35:43
          Frodo that was indeed Boromir as I knew him for the Golden Belt was given to him in Loth by the lady gadriel she it was that clothed us as you see us in Elven gray this brooch is of the same workmanship he touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak beneath his throat fmir looked closely at it it is beautiful he said yes it is work of the same craft so then you passed through the land of lauran laurelin Doran as it was named of old but long now it has Lain beyond the knowledge of men he

          
          32:36:23
          added softly regarding Frodo with a new Wonder in his eyes much that was strange about you I begin now to understand will you not tell me more for it is a bitter thought that Boromir died within sight of the land of his home no more can I say than I have said answered Frodo though your tale fills me with forboding a vision it was that you saw I think and no more some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy I have seen the faces of fair Warriors of old laid in sleep beneath

          
          32:37:00
          the pools of the Dead marshes or seeming so by his foul Arts nay it was not so said fimir for his Works fill the heart with loathing but my heart was filled with grief and pity yet how could such a thing have happened in truth asked Frodo for no boat could have been carried over the Stony Hills from tall Brer and Boromir purposed to go home along the ENT wash in the fields of Rohan and yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the Great Falls and not found her in the boiling pools though Laden with water I know not

          
          32:37:37
          said faramir but whence came the boat from laurian said Frodo in three such boats we rode down the andwin to the fs they also were of Elven work you passed through the hidden land said fameer but it seems that you little understood its power if men have dealings with a mistress of magic who dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to follow for it is perilous for Mortal man to walk out of the world of this sun and few of old ever came then unchanged to said Boromir oh bomir he cried what did

          
          32:38:17
          she say to you the lady that dies not what did she see what woke in your heart then why went you ever to Laurel IND Doran and came not by your own Road upon the horses of Rohan riding home in the morning then turning again to Frodo he spoke in a quiet Voice once more to those questions I guess that you could make some answer Frodo son of Drogo but not here or now maybe but lest you still should think my tale a vision I will tell you this the Horn of Boromir at least returned in truth and not in

          
          32:38:53
          seeming the horn came but it was clo in two as it were by axe or sword the shards came severally to shore one was found among the Reeds where watches of gondo lay northwards beyond the infolds of the anash the other was found spinning on the flood by one who had an errand on the water strange chances but murder will out his said and now the Horn of the Elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of denor sitting in his high chair waiting for news and you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of the

          
          32:39:28
          horn no I didn't know of it said Frodo but the day when you heard it blowing if your Reckoning is true was the day when we parted and I and my servant left the company and now your tale fills me with Dread for if Boromir was then in Peril and was slain I must fear that all my companions perished too and they were are my Kindred and my friends will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go I'm weary and full of grief and afraid but I have a deed to do or to attempt before I too am slain and the

          
          32:40:03
          more need of haste if we to halflings are all that remain of our fellowship go back fame Valiant captain of Gondor and defend your city while you may and let me go where my Doom takes me for me there is no comfort in our speech together said fameer but you surely draw from it more dread than need be unless the people of lauan themselves came to him who aray Boromir as for a funeral not Orcs or Servants of the nameless some of your company I guess live still but whatever befell on the North March you Frodo I doubt no longer if

          
          32:40:45
          hard days have made me any drudge of men's words and faces then I make a guess at halflings though and now he smiled there is something strange about you Frodo an Elvish air maybe but more lies Upon Our words together than I thought at first I should now take you back to minth to answer there to denior and my life will justly be forfeit if I now choose a course that proves ill for my city so I will not decide in haste what is to be done yet we must move hence without more delay he sprang to his feet and issued some orders at once

          
          32:41:22
          the men who were gathered around him broke up into small groups and went off this way and that Vanishing quickly into the Shadows of the rocks and trees soon only mablung and damrod remained now you Frodo and Sam wise will come with me and my guards said faramir you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose it will be unsafe for some days and always more closely watched after this arra than has been yet and you cannot I think go far today in any case for you're weary and so are we we

          
          32:41:58
          are going now to a secret place we have somewhat less than 10 miles from here the Orcs And Spies of the enemy have not found it yet and if they did we could hold it long even against many there we may lie up and rest for a while and you with us in the morning I will decide what is best for me to do and for you there was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request or order it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment since this foray of the men of Gondor had made a journey in eelan more dangerous than

          
          32:42:36
          ever they set out at once mablung and damrod a little ahead and faramir with Frodo and Sam behind skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed they they crossed the stream climbed a long bank and passed into green shadowed Woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards while they walked as swiftly as the hobbits could go they talked in hushed voices I broke off our speech together said phir not only because time pressed as Master Sam wise had reminded me but also because we were Drawing Near to

          
          32:43:15
          matters that were better not debated openly before many men it was for that reason that I turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be islor's ban you are not holy Frank with me froder I told no lies and of the truth all I could said froder I do not blame you said fmir you spoke with skill in a hard place and wisely it seemed to me but I learned or guessed more from you than your words said you were not friendly with Boromir or you did not part in Friendship you and master Sam wiise too I guess have

          
          32:43:54
          some grievance now I loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his death yet I knew him well islor's Bane I would Hazard that islor's banee lay between you and was a cause of contention in your company clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and such things do not breed peace among Confederates not if ought may be learned from ancient Tales do I not hit near the mark near said Frodo but not in the gold there was no contention in our company though there was doubt doubt which way we should take from the Emin wheel but

          
          32:44:34
          be that as it may ancient Tales teach us also the Peril of rash words concerning such things as heirlooms ah then it is as I thought your trouble was with bmir alone he wished this thing brought to minth Alas it is a crooked fate that seals your lips who saw him last and holds for me that which I long to know what was in his heart and thought in his latest hours whether he heard or no of this I am sure he died well achieved some good thing his face was more beautiful even that in life but Frodo I pressed you

          
          32:45:18
          hard at first about is Bane forgive me it was unwise in such an hour and place I had not had time for thought we'd had a hard fight and there was more than enough to fill my mind but even as I spoke with you I drew nearer to the mark and so deliberately shot wider for you must know that much is still preserved of ancient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad we of my house are not of the line of a lending still though the blood of numor is in us for we reckon back our line to Mill the good Steward who ruled

          
          32:45:58
          in the kingstead when he went away to war and that was King aor last of the line of anarion and childless and he never came back and the stewards have governed the city since that day though it was many generations of men ago and this I remember of B as a boy when we together learned the tale of our s and the history of our city that always it displeased him that his father was not King how many hundreds of years needs it to make a steward a king if the king returns not he asked few years maybe in

          
          32:46:40
          other places of less royalty my father answered in Gondor 10,000 years would not suffice Alas poor bmir does that not tell you something of him it does said Frodo yet always he treated Aragon With Honor I doubt it not said faramir if he were satisfied of Aragon's claim as you say he would greatly reverence him but the pinch has not yet come they had not yet reached minth or become rivals in her Wars but I Stray we in the house of De anthor know much ancient law by long tradition and there are moreover in our treasuries

          
          32:47:25
          many things preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchments yay and on Stone and on leaves of silver and of gold in divers characters some none can now read and for the rest few ever unlock them I can read a little in them for I have had teaching it was these records that brought the great Pilgrim to us I first saw him when I was a child and he's been twice or Thrice since then the gray Pilgrim said Frodo had he a name myth rander we called him in elf fashion said fimir and he was content many are my names in many

          
          32:48:08
          countries he said myth rander among the elves Thon to the dwarves Allin I was in my youth in the west that is forgotten in the south inaros in the north Gandalf to the east I go not gandal said Frodo I thought it was he Gandalf the gy dearest of counselors leader of our company he was lost in Moria myth rander was lost said faramir an evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship it is hard indeed to believe that one of so great wisdom and of power for many wonderful things he did among us could perish and so much law be taken

          
          32:48:56
          from the world are you sure of this and that he did not just leave you and depart where he would alas yes said Fodor I saw him fall into the abyss I see that there is some great tale of dread in this said faramir which perhaps you may tell me in the evening time the this Smith rander was I now guess more than a law Master a great mover of the Deeds that are done in our time had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our Dream he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger yet maybe he

          
          32:49:36
          wouldn't have done so and the journey of bmir was doomed myth rander never spoke to us of what was to be nor did it reveal his purposes he got leave of denior how I don't know to look at the secrets of our Treasury and I learned a little of him when he would teach and that was seldom ever he would search and would question us Above All Else concerning the great battle that was fought upon dagad in the beginning of Gondor when he whom we do not name was overthrown and he was eager for stories of isor though of him we had less to

          
          32:50:15
          tell for nothing certain was ever known among us of his end now faramir's voice sank to a whisper but this much I learned or guessed and I have kept it ever Secret in my heart since that ISL Tor took somewhat from the hand of the unnamed a he went away from Gondor never to be seen among mortal men again here I thought was the answer to myth rand's questioning but it seemed then a matter that concerned Only The Seekers after ancient learning nor when the riddling words of our Dream were debated Among Us did I

          
          32:50:54
          think of islor's Bane as being the same thing for isor was ambushed and slain by orc arows according to the only legend that we knew and myth rander had never told me more what in truth this thing is I cannot yet guess but some air Loom of power and Peril it must be a fail weapon per chance devised by the dark Lord if it were a thing that gave advantage in battle I can well believe that Boromir the proud and fearless often rash ever anxious for the victory of minth and his own Glory therein might desire such a

          
          32:51:34
          thing and be allured by it alas that ever he went on that errand I should have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward as being the older and the hardier both true and he would not be stayed but fear no more I would not take this thing if it lay by the highway not were Min tith falling in ruin and I alone could save her so using the weapon of the dark lord for her good and my glory no I do not wish for such triumphs Frodo son of Drogo neither did the council said Frodo

          
          32:52:16
          nor do I I would have nothing to do with such matters for myself said farer I would see the white tree and flow again in the courts of the Kings and the silver crown return and minth in peace Min Anor again as of old full of light high and fair beautiful as a queen among other queens not a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind Mistress of willing slaves war must be while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all but I don't love the bright sword for its sharpness nor the arrow for its

          
          32:52:56
          swiftness nor the warrior for his glory I love only that which they defend the city of the men of numor and I would have her loved for her memory her ancientry her beauty and her present wisdom not feared save as men may fear the Dignity of a man old and wise so fear me not I don't ask you to tell me more I don't even ask you to tell me whether I now speak near to the mark But if you will trust me it may be that I can advise you in your present Quest whatever that be yes and even Aid you Frodo made no

          
          32:53:40
          answer almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel to tell this grave young man whose words seemed so wise and fair all that was in his mind but something held him back his heart was Heavy with fear and sorrow if he and Sam were indeed as seemed likely all that was now left of the nine Walkers then he was in sole command of The Secret of that errand better mistrust undeserved than rash words and the memory of Boromir of the Dreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in him was very present

          
          32:54:17
          to his mind when he looked at faramir and listened to his voice unlike they were and yet also much Akin they walked on in silence for a while passing like gray and green Shadows under the old trees their feet making no sound above them many Birds Sang and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the Evergreen Woods of eelan Sam had taken no part in the conversation though he had had listened and at the same time he had attended with his Keen Hobbit ears to all the soft Woodland noises about them

          
          32:54:57
          one thing he had noted that in all the talk the name of Gollum had not once come up he was glad though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would never hear it again he soon became aware also that though they walked alone there were many men close at hand not only damrod and mablung flitting In and Out of the Shadows ahead but others on either side all making their Swift secret way to some appointed Place once looking suddenly back as if some prickle of the skin told him that he was watched from

          
          32:55:34
          behind he thought he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark shape slipping behind a tree trunk he opened his mouth to speak and shut it again I'm not sure of it he said to himself and why should I remind them of the old villain if they choose to forget him I wish I could so they passed on until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began to fall more steeply then they turned aside again to the right and came quickly to a small River in the narrow Gorge it was the same stream that trickled far above out

          
          32:56:13
          of the round pool now grown to a swift torrent leaping down over many stones in a deep clo bed overhung with eyex and dark box Woods looking West they could see below them in a haze of light lowlands and Broad Mees and glinting far off in the westering Sun the Wide Waters of the anduin here alas I must do you a discourtesy said phir I hope you will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to Courtesy as not to slay you or to bind you but it is a command that no stranger not even one of Rohan that

          
          32:56:55
          fights with us shall see the path we now go with open eyes I must blindfold you as you will said Frodo even the elves do likewise at need and blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair looran gimly the dwarf took it ill but the hobbits endured it it is no place so fair that I should lead you said fameer but I'm glad that you will take this willingly and not by force he called softly and immediately marlong and damrod stepped out of the trees and came back to him blindfold these guests said faramir securely but

          
          32:57:36
          not so as to discomfort them do not tie their hands they will give their word not to try and see I could trust them to shut their eyes of their own accord but eyes will blink if the feet St stumble lead them so that they do not falter with green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbit's eyes and Drew their hoods down almost to their mouths then quickly they took each one by the hand and went on their way all that Frodo and Sam knew of this last mile of the road they learned from guessing in

          
          32:58:09
          the dark after a little they found that they were on a path descending steeply soon it grew so narrow that they went in single file brushing a Stony wall on either side their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while and then set down again always the noise of the running water was on their right hand and it grew nearer and louder at length they were halted quickly marlong and damrod turned

          
          32:58:43
          them about several times and they lost all sense of direction the they climbed upwards a little it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint then they were picked up and carried down down many steps and round a corner suddenly they heard the water again loud now rushing and splashing all around them it seemed and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks at last they were set on their feet once more for a moment they stood so half fearful blindfold not knowing where they were

          
          32:59:18
          and no one spoke then came the voice of thamir close behind let them see he said the scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped they stood on a wet floor of polished Stone the doorstep as it were of a rough hee gate of rock opening dark behind them but in front a thin veil of water was hung so near that Frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it it faced Westward the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon it and the red light was broken to many flickering

          
          32:59:57
          beams of everchanging color it was as if they stood at the window of some Elven Tower curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold and ruby sapphire and amethyst all kindled with an unconsumed fire At Last by good chance we come at the right hour to reward you for your patience said far this is the window of the sunset hananon fairest of all the fair of ethelon land of many fountains few strangers have ever seen it but there is no kingly Hall behind it to match it enter now and see even as he spoke the sun sank and

          
          33:00:42
          the fire faded in the flowing water they turned and passed under the low forbidding Arch at once they found themselves in a rock chamber wide and rough with an uneven stooping roof a few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls many men were already there others were still coming in by twos and threes through a dark narrow door on one side as their eyes grew accustomed to the Gloom The Hobbit saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was filled with great store of arms and vittles

          
          33:01:19
          well here is our refuge said faramir not a place of great ease but here you may pass the night in peace it is dry at least and there is food though no far at one time the water flowed down through this cave and out of the arch but its course was changed further up the gorge by workmen of old and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over the Rocks far above all the ways into this grot were then sealed against the entrance of water or ought else all save one there are now but two ways that

          
          33:01:53
          passage R by which you entered blindfold and through the window curtain into a deep Bowl filled with knives of stone now rest a while until the evening meal is set the hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to Li on if they wished meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quietly and in orderly quickness light tables were taken from the walls and set up on trestles and Laden with gear this was plain and unadorned for the most part but all well and fairly made round platters bowls and dishes of

          
          33:02:33
          glazed brown clay or turned boxwood smooth and clean here and there was a cup or Basin of polished bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by the captain's seat in the middle of the inmost table thamir went about among the men questioning each as he came in in a soft voice some came back from the pursuit of the southrons others Left Behind as Scouts near the road came in latest all the southrons had been accounted for Save only the great mumak what happened to him none could say of the enemy no

          
          33:03:12
          movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abroad you saw and heard nothing unborn faramir asked of the latest Comer well no lord said the man no orc at least but I saw or thought I saw something a little strange it was getting deep dusk when the eyes made things greater than they should be so perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel Sam picked up his ears at this yet if so it was a black squirrel and I saw no tail it was like a shadow on the ground found and it whisked behind a tree trunk when I drew nigh and went up

          
          33:03:52
          a loft as Swift as any squirrel could you will not have a slay wild beasts for no purpose and it seemed no more so I tried no Arrow it was too dark for Shore shooting anyway and the creature was gone into the Gloom of the leaves in a twinkling but I stayed for a while for it seemed strange and then I hastened back I thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as I turned away a large squirrel maybe perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some of the beasts of merkwood are wandering hither to our

          
          33:04:25
          woods they have black squirrels there t said perhaps said fimir but that would be an ill Omen if it were so we don't want the escapes of merkwood in aelan Sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards the Hobbit as he spoke but Sam said nothing for a while he and Frodo lay back and watched the torch light and the men moving to and fro speaking in harush voices then suddenly Frodo fell asleep Sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that he may be all right he thought and then he may not fair speech May hide a

          
          33:05:07
          foul heart he yawned I could sleep for a week and I'd be better for it and what could I do if I do keep awake me all alone and all these Great Men about nothing Sam gamji but you've got to keep awake all the same and somehow he managed it the light faded from the cave door and the gray veil of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering Shadow always the sound of the water went on never changing its note morning or evening or night it murmured and whispered of sleep Sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes

          
          33:05:50
          now more torches were being lit a CK of wine was broached storage barrels were being opened men were fetching water from the fall some were leaving their hands in basins a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought to fimir and he washed wake our guests he said and take them water it's time to eat froda sat up and yawned and stretched Sam not used to being waited on looked with some surprise at The Tall Man Who bowed holding a basin of water before him put it on the ground Master if you please he said easier for me and you

          
          33:06:34
          then to the astonishment and amusement of the men he plunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper said the man who waited on the hobbits now before breakfast said Sam but if you're short of sleep cold water on the necks like rain on a wilted lettuce there now I can keep awake long enough to eat a bit they were LED then to seats beside phir barrels covered with pelts and high enough above the benches of the men for their

          
          33:07:10
          convenience before they ate fameer and all his men turned and faced West in a moment of silence fameus signed to Frodo and Sam that they should do likewise so we always do he said as they sat down we look towards numor that was and Beyond to Elven home that is and to that which is beyond Elven home and will ever be have you no such custom at meat no said Frodo feeling strangely rustic and unted but if we are guests we bow to our host and after we have eaten We rise and thank him that we do also said

          
          33:07:53
          fameer after so long journeying and camping and days spent in the lonely wild the evening meal seemed a feast to the Hobbits to drink pale yellow wine cool and fragrant and eat bread and butter and salted meats and dried fruits and good red cheese with Clean Hands and clean knives and plates neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything that was was offered nor a second nor indeed a third helping the wine caed in their veins and tired Limbs and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the

          
          33:08:29
          land of lauran when all was done faramir LED them to a recess at the back of the cave partly screened by curtains and a chair and two stools were brought there a little Earth andwar lamp burned in a niche you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially Good Sam wise who would not close his eyes before he ate whether for fear of blunting the edge of a noble hunger or for fear of me I don't know but it's not good to sleep too soon after meat and that following a fast let us talk a while on your journey from

          
          33:09:07
          rivendel there must have been many things to tell and you too would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the lands where you now are tell me of bom my brother and of old mith randier and of the fair people of Loth laan Frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk but though the food and wine had put him at his ease he hadn't lost all his caution Sam was beaming and humming to himself but when Frodo spoke he was at first content to listen only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of

          
          33:09:44
          agreement Frodo told many tales yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the company and from The Ring enlarging rather on the Valiant part bmir had played in all their Adventures With The Wolves of the wild in the Snows under kathas and in the mines of Moria where gandal fell thamir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge it must have irked Boromir to run from Orcs he said or even from the F thing you name the balrog even though he was the last to leave he was the last

          
          33:10:21
          said Frodo but Aragon was forced to lead us he alone knew the way after Gandalf's fall but had there not been us lesser folk to care for I don't think that either he or bmir would have fled maybe it would have been better had bmir fallen there with Mander said fmir and not gone on to the Fate that waited above the Falls of Ros Maybe but tell me now of your own fortunes said Frodo turning the matter aside once again for I would learn more of mini and Os gillath and Min tith the long enduring what hope have you for

          
          33:11:00
          that City in your long War what hope have we said farer it is long since we had any hope the sword of alil if it returns indeed May rekindle it but I don't think that it will do more than put off the evil day unless other help unlooked for also comes from elves or men for the enemy increases and we decrease we are a failing people a springless Autumn the men of Noor were settled far and wide on the shores and sea would regions of the great lands but for the most part they fell into evils and Follies many became en armored of the

          
          33:11:40
          darkness and the Black Arts some were given over wholly to idleness and ease and some fought among themselves until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men it's not said that evil Arts were ever practiced in Gondor or that the nameless one was ever named in honor there and the old wisdom and Beauty brought out of the West remained long in the realm of the sons of elendil the fair and they linger there still yet even so it was Gondor that brought about its own Decay Falling by degrees into dotage and thinking that

          Arian had no air but the stewards were wiser and more fortunate wiser for they recruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the Sea Coast and from the Hardy Mountaineers of erid nraas and they made a truce with the proud peoples of the north who often had assailed us men of fierce Valor but our kin from AAR off unlike the wild easterlings or the cruel haradrim so it came to pass in the days of kidan the 12th Steward and my father is the six and 20th that they rode to our Aid and at the great field of Kant

          Twilight but with memory of other things for as the roim do we now love war and Valor as things good in themselves both a sport and an end and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying we esteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other crafts such is the need of our days so even was my brother Boromir a man of press and for that he was accounted the best man in Gondor and very Valiant indeed he was no heir of Min tith has for long years been so

          hardy and toil so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn side and fell silent for a while you don't say much in all your tales about the elves sir said Sam suddenly plucking up courage he' noted that fmir seemed to refer to elves with reverence and this even more than his courtesy and his food and wine had won Sam's respect and quieted his suspicions no indeed Master Sam wise said fimir for I'm not learned in Elven law but there you T upon another point in which we have changed declining from

          
          33:16:50
          numor to Middle Earth for as you may know if myth Rand was your companion and you have spoken with Elon the Edan the fathers of the noorans fought beside the elves in the first Wars and were awarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the sea within sight of Elven home but in Middle Earth men and elves became estranged in the days of darkness by the Arts of the enemy and by the slow changes of time in which each kind walked further down their suered roads men now fear and misdoubt the elves and

          
          33:17:27
          yet know little of them and we have gone door grow like other men like the men of Rohan for even they who are the foes of the dark lord shun The Elves and speak of the golden wood with Dread yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the elves when they may and ever and Anon one will go in secret to laurian seldom to return not I for I deem it perilous now for Mortal man willfully to seek out the Elder people yet I envy you that have spoken with a white lady the lady of lauan Galadriel cried

          
          33:18:05
          Sam you should see her indeed you should sir I'm only a hobbit and gardening is my job at home sir if you understand me and I'm not much good at po poetry not at making it a bit of a comic rhyme perhaps now and again you know but not real poetry so I can't tell you what I mean it ought to be sung you'd have to get Strider Aragon that is or old Mr Bilbo for that but I wish I could make a song about her beautiful she is Sir lovely sometimes like a great tree and flower sometimes like a white daer Down

          
          33:18:45
          Dilly small and SL slender likee hard as diamonds soft as Moonlight warm as sunlight cold as Frost in the Stars proud and far off as a snow mountain and as merry as any lass I ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime but that's a lot of nonsense and all wide of my mark then she must be lovely indeed said fameer perilously fair I don't know about perilous said Sam it strikes me that folk takes their Peril with them into laurian and finds it there because they brought it but perhaps you could

          
          33:19:23
          call her perilous because she's so strong in herself you you could Dash yourself to pieces on her like a ship on a rock or drown yourself like a hobbit in a river but neither Rock nor River would be to blame now borrow he stopped and went red in the face yes now Boromir you would say said faramir what would you say he took his Peril with him yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as your brother was if I may say so but you've been warm on the scent all along now I watched barir and listened to him from rivendel

          
          33:20:05
          all down the road looking after my master as you'll understand and not meaning any harm to barir and it's my opinion that in lauan he first saw clearly what I guess sooner what he wanted from the moment he first saw it he wanted the enemy's ring Sam cried Frodo a gast he'd Fallen deep into his own thoughts for a while and came out of them suddenly and too late save me said Sam turning white and then flushing Scarlet there I go again whenever you open your big mouth and put your foot in it the gaffer used to say to me and

          
          33:20:43
          right enough oh dear oh dear now look here sir he turned facing up to fimir with all the courage that he could Master don't you go take an advantage of my master because his servants know better than a fool you've spoken very handsome all along put me off my guard talking of elves and all but handsome is as handsome does we say now's a chance to show your quality so it seems said fameer slowly and very softly with a strange smile so that is the answer to all the riddles the one ring that was thought to have

          
          33:21:21
          perished from the world and Boromir tried to take it by force and you escaped and ran all the way to me and here in the wild I have you two halflings and a host of men at my call and the Ring of rings a pretty stroke of Fortune a chance for ther captain of Gondor to show his quality huh he stood up very tall and Stern his gray eyes glinting Frodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with their backs to the wall fumbling for their sword hilts there was a silence all the men in the cave stopped

          
          33:22:00
          talking and looked towards them in Wonder but faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly and then suddenly became grave again alas for bmir it was too sore a trial he said I you have increased my sorrow you two strange Wanderers from a far country bearing the Peril of men but you are less judges of men than I of halflings we are truth speakers We Men of Gondor we boast seldom and then perform or die in the attempt not if I found it on the highway would I take it I said even if I were

          
          33:22:41
          such a man as to desire this thing and even though I knew not clearly what this thing was when I spoke still I should take those words as a vow and be held by them but I am not such a man or I am wise enough to know that there are some perils from which a man must flee sit at peace and be comforted Sam wise if you seem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so your heart is shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your eyes for strange though it may seem it was safe to declare this this to me it

          
          33:23:18
          may even help the master that you love it shall turn to his good if it is in my power so be comforted but do not even name this thing again aloud once is enough the hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet men turned back to their drink and their talk perceiving that their Captain had had some Gest or other with the little guests and that it was over when well Frodo now at last we understand one another said faramir if you took this thing on yourself unwilling at others asking then you have

          
          33:23:56
          pity and honor from me and I Marvel at you to keep it hid and not to use it you are a new people and a new world to me are all your kin of like sort your land must be a realm of peace and content and there must gardeners be in high honor not all is well there said Frodo but certainly gardeners are honored but folk must grow weary there even in their Gardens as do all things under the sun of this world and you are far from home and wayworn no more tonight sleep both of you in peace if you can fear not I don't wish to see it

          
          33:24:39
          or touch it or know more of it than I know which is enough lest Peril per chance waylay me and I fall lower in the test than Frodo son of Drogo go now to rest but first tell me only if you will whether you wish to go and what to do for I must watch and wait and think time passes in the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us Frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed now a great weirdness came down on him like a cloud he could dissemble and resist no longer I was going to find a way into

          
          33:25:24
          Mordor he said faintly I was going to goras I must find the Mountain of Fire and cast the thing into the Gulf of Doom Gandalf said so I don't think I shall ever get there thamir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment then suddenly he caught him as he swayed and lifting him gently carried him to the bed and laid him there and covered him warmly at once he fell into a deep sleep another bed was set beside him for his servant Sam hesitated for a moment then bowing very low good night captain

          
          33:26:05
          my Lord he said you took the chance sir did I so said Fame yes sir and showed your equality the very highest Fame smiled a per servant Master Sam wise but nay the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards yet there was not in this to praise I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done I well sir said Sam you said my master had an Elish air and that was good and true but I can say this you have an air too sir that reminds me of of well Gandalf of wizards maybe said phir maybe you aern

          
          33:26:53
          from far away the heir of numo good night chapter 6 The Forbidden pool Frodo woke to find fatmir bending over him for a second old fear seized him and he sat up and shrank away there is nothing to fear said fameer is it morning already said Frodo yawning not yet but night is drawing to an end and the full moon is setting will you come and see it also there is a matter on which I desire your counsel I'm sorry to Rouse you from sleep but will you come I will said Frodo rising and shivering a little as he left the warm

          
          33:27:43
          blanket and pelts it seemed cold in the fireless cave the noise of the water was loud in the Stillness he put on his cloak and followed faramir Sam waking Suddenly by some Instinct of watchfulness Saw first his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet then he saw two dark figures Frodo and a man framed against the archway which was now filled with a pale white light he hurried after them passed rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall as he went by the cave mouth he saw that the curtain was now become a dazzling

          
          33:28:23
          veil of silk and pearls and Silver Thread melting icicles of moonlight but he did not pause to admire it and turning aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in the wall of the cave they went first along a black passage then up many wet steps and so came to a small flat Landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky gleaming high above through a long deep shaft from here two flights of steps LED one going on as it seemed up on to the high Bank of the stream the other turning away to the left this they followed it

          
          33:29:01
          wound its way up like a turret stair at last they came out of the Stony darkness and looked about they were on a wide Flat Rock without rail or parapet at their right eastwards the torrent fell splashing over many Terraces and then pouring down a steep race it filled a smooth Humane Channel with a dark force of water Fleck with foam and curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upon their left a man stood there near the brink silent gazing down Frodo turned to watch the Sleek

          
          33:29:41
          necks of the water as they curved and dived then he lifted his eyes and gave Ed far away the world was quiet and cold as if Dawn were near far off in the west the full moon was sinking round and white pale Mists shimmered in the great Veil below a wide Gulf of silver fume beneath which rolled the cool night Waters of the andwin a black darkness loomed Beyond and in it tinted here and there cold sharp remote white as the teeth of ghosts the peaks of eded Rees the White Mountains of the realm of Gondor tipped with Everlasting

          
          33:30:22
          snow for a while Frodo stood there on the high stone and a shiver ran through him wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the nightlands his old companions walked or slept or lay dead shrouded in mist why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep Sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refin himself from muttering for his master's ear alone as he thought it's a fine view no doubt Mr Frodo but chilly to the art not to mention the bones what's going on faramir heard and answered moon set over

          
          33:30:59
          Gondor Fair eill as it goes from Middle Earth glances upon the white locks of old Molin it is worth a few Shivers but that is not what I brought you see though as for you Sam wise you were not brought and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness a draft of wine shall amend it come look now he stepped up beside the silent Sentinel on the dark Edge and Frodo followed Sam hung back he already felt insecure enough on this High wet platform faramir and Frodo looked down far below them they saw the white waters

          
          33:31:40
          pour into a foaming bowl and then swirl Darkly about a deep oval Basin in the rocks until they found their way out again through a narrow gate and flowed away fuming and chattering into calmer and More Level reaches the Moonlight still slanted down to the F's foot and gleamed on the ripples of the Basin presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on the near bank but even as he looked at it it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble of the Fall cleaving the black water as neatly as an nrow or an

          
          33:32:17
          edge wise Stone thamir turned to the man at his side now what would you say that is unborn a squiddle or a king fisher are there black king fishes in the night pools of merkwood there's not a bird whatever else it be answered enborne it has four Limbs and Dives man wise a pretty Mastery of the crafter chills too what is it at seeking a way up behind the curtain to our hidings it seems we're discovered At Last I have my bow here and I have posted other archers n as good Marksman as myself on either Bank

          
          33:33:00
          we wait only for your commands to shoot Captain shall we shoot said faramir turning quickly to Frodo Frodo didn't answer for a moment then no he said no I beg you not to if Sam had dared he would have said yes quick and Loud he couldn't see but he guessed well enough from their words what they were looking at you know then what this thing is said fameer come now you have seen tell me why it should be spared in all our words together you have not once spoken of your Gangrel companion and I let him be for the time

          
          33:33:38
          he could wait till he was caught and brought before us I sent my keenest Huntsman to seek him but he slipped them and they had no sight of him till now save unborn here once at dusk yesterday evening but now he's done worse trespass than only to go Cony snaring in the Uplands he has dared to come to henneth Anon and his life is forfeit I Marvel at the creature so secret and so Sly as he is to come sporting in the pool before our very window does he think that men sleep without watch all night why does

          
          33:34:13
          he so there answers I think said Frodo for one thing he knows little of men and Sly though he is your Refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not know that men are concealed here for another I think he is allured here by a mastering desire stronger than his caution he is Led here then you say said faramir in a low voice can he does he then know of your burden indeed yes he bought it himself for many years he bore it said phir breathing sharply in his Wonder this matter winds itself ever in New riddles then he is pursuing

          
          33:34:56
          it maybe it is precious to him but I did not speak of that what then does the creature seek fish said Frodo look they peered down at the dark pool a little black head appeared at the far end of the Basin just out of of the deep shadow of the Rocks there was a brief silver glint and a swirl of tiny ripples it swam to the side and then with marvelous agility a frog-like figure climbed out of the water and up the bank at once it sat down and began to G at the small silver thing that glittered as it turned the last rays of the moon were

          
          33:35:37
          now falling behind the Stony wall at the Pool's end theab laughed softly fish he said it is a less perilous hunger or maybe not fish from the pool of henneth unnown May cost him all he has to give now I have him at the arrow point said unborn shall I not shoot Captain for coming unbidden to this place death is our law wait andorn said fimir this is a harder matter than it seems what have you to say now Frodo why should we spare the creature is wretched and hungry said fro and unaware of his danger and Gandalf your myth rander he

          
          33:36:22
          would have bidden you not to slay him for that reason and for others he forbad the elves to do so I don't know clearly why and of what I guess I cannot speak openly out here but this creature is in some way bound up with my errand until you found us and took us he was my guide your guide said fimir the matter becomes ever stranger I would do much for you Frodo but this I cannot Grant to let this Sly wander Go free at his own will from here to join you later if it please him or to be caught by Orcs And tell all he knows

          
          33:36:59
          under threat of pain he must be slain or taken slain if he be not taken very swiftly but how can this slippery thing of many geysers be caught Sav by a feathered traft let me go down quietly to him said Frodo you may keep your bows bent and shoot me at least if I fail I Shan run away go then and be swift said faramir if he comes off alive he should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days lead F down to the bank unborn and go softly the thing has a nose and ears give me your bow unborn grunted and led the way down

          
          33:37:41
          the Winding Stair to The Landing and then up the other stair until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes passing silently through Frodo found himself on the top of the Southern Bank above the pool it was now dark and the Falls were pale and gray reflecting only the lingering Moonlight of the Western sky he couldn't see Gollum he went forward a short way and unborn came softly behind him go on he breathed in Frodo's ear have a care right if you fall in the pool then no no

          
          33:38:15
          one but your fishing friend can help you and forget not that there are Bowman near at hand though you may not see them Frodo crept forward using his hands Gollum like to feel his way and to steady himself the Rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery he halted listening at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing rush of the fall behind him then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing murmur fish nice fish white face has vanished my precious at last yes now we can eat fish in peace no not in peace precious

          
          33:39:02
          for precious is last year's last dirty Hobbits nasty Hobbits G and left us colum and precious is gone only poor smeagle all alone no precious nasty men they'll take it steal my precious thieves We hatte Them fish nice fish makes us strong makes eyes bright fingers tight yes shle them prous throttle them all yes if we get chances nice f fish nice fish so it went on almost as unceasing as the waterfall only interrupted by a faint noise of slaving and gurgling Frodo shivered listening with pity and disgust he wished it would stop

          
          33:40:03
          and that he never need hear that voice again anborn was not far behind he could creep back and ask him to get the Huntsman to shoot they would probably get close enough while Gollum was gorging and off his guard only one true shot and Frodo would be rid of the miserable voice forever but no golum had a claim on him now the servant has a claim on the master for service even service in fear they would have found it in the dead marshes but for Gollum Frodo Knew Too somehow quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it smeagle

          
          33:40:41
          he said softly fish nice fish said the voice smeagle he said a little louder the voice stopped smeagle master has come to look for you master is here come smigle there was no answer but a soft hiss as of in Taken breath come smigle said Frodo we're in danger men will kill you if they find you here come quickly if you wish to escape death come to master no said the voice no not nice master leaves poor smeagle and goes with new friends Master can wait smeagle hasn't finished there's no time said Frodo bring fish with you come no must

          
          33:41:31
          finish fish smeagle said Frodo desperately precious will be angry I shall take Precious and I shall say make him swallow the bones and choke never taste fish again come precious is way there was a sharp hiss presently out of the darkness Gollum came crawling on all fours like an earing dog called to heal he had a half eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand he came close to Frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him his pale eyes were shining then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood

          
          33:42:07
          up nice master he whispered nice hobbit come back to poor smeagle good smeagle comes now let's go go quickly yes through the trees while the faces are dark yes come let's go yes we'll go soon said Frodo but not at once I will go with you as I promised I promise again but not now you are not safe yet I will save you but you must trust me we must trust Master said Gollum doubtfully why why not go at once where is the other one the crush rude Hobbit where is he a way up there said Frodo pointing to the waterfall I'm not going

          
          33:42:57
          without him we must go back to him his heart sank this was too much like trickery he didn't really fear that Fame would allow Gollum to be killed and he would probably make him prisoner and bind him and certainly what Frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature it would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could what else could he do to keep Faith as near as might be with both sides come he said or the precious will

          
          33:43:34
          be angry we are going back now up the stream go on go on you go in front Gollum crawled along close to the bank for a little way snuffling and suspicious presently he stopped and raised his head something's there he said not a hobbit suddenly he turned back a green light was flickering in his bulging eyes master master he HED Wicked tricky false he spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping fingers at that moment the great black shape of unborn loomed up behind him and came down on him a large strong hand

          
          33:44:16
          took him in the nape of the neck and pinned him he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimy as he was wriggling like an eel biting and scratching like a cat but two more men came up out of the Shadows hold still said one oh we'll stick you as full of pins as a hedgehog hold still Gollum went limp and began to whine and weep they tied him none too gently easy easy said Frodo he has no strength to match you don't hurt him if you can help it he'll be quieter if you don't smeagle they won't hurt you I'll

          
          33:44:52
          go with you and you shall come to no harm not unless they kill me too trust Master Gollum turned and spat at him the men picked him up put a hood over his eyes and carried him off Frodo followed them feeling very wretched they went through the opening behind the bushes and back down the stairs and passages into the cave two or three torches had been lit men were staring Sam was there and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried got him he said to froto yes well no I didn't get him he

          
          33:45:30
          came to me because he trusted me at first I'm afraid I didn't want him tied up like this I hope it will be all right but I hate the whole business so do I said Sam and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is a man came and beckoned to the hobbits and took them to the recess at the back of the cave fmir was sitting there in his chair and the lamp had been rekindled in its Niche above his head he signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him bring wine for the guests he said

          
          33:46:05
          and bring the prisoner to me the wine was brought and then unborn came carrying Gollum he had removed the cover from gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to support him Gollum blinked Hing the malice of his eyes with the heavy pale Lids a very miserable creature he looked dripping and dank smelling of fish he still clutched one in his hand his sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony brows his nose was sniveling Lo us he said the cord hurts us yes it does it hurts us and we've

          
          33:46:45
          done nothing nothing said fimir looking at The Wretched creature with a keen glance but without any expression in his face either of anger or pity or wonder nothing have you never done anything worthy of binding or of worse punishment however that is not for me to judge happily but tonight you have come where it is death to come the fish of this pool are dearly bought Gollum dropped the fish from his hand don't want fish he said the price is not set on the fish said fameer only to come here and look on the pool Bears

          
          33:47:25
          the penalty of death I've spared you so far at the prayer of Frodo here who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks but you must also satisfy me what is your name whence do you come and whether do you go what is your business we are lost lost said Gollum no name no business no precious nothing only empty only hungry yes we're hungry a few little fishes nasty bony little fishes for a poor creature and they say death so wise they are so just so very just not very wise said fimir but just yes perhaps

          
          33:48:16
          as just as our little wisdom allows unloose him Frodo fimir took a small nail knife from his belt and handed it to Frodo Gollum misunderstanding the gesture squealed and fell down now smeagle said Frodo you must trust me I will not desert you answer truthfully if you can it will do you good not harm he cut the cords on gollum's wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet come hither said fimir look at me do you know the name of this place have you been here before slowly Gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into

          
          33:48:56
          fatmir all light went out of them and they stared Bleak and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes of the man of Gondor there was a still silence then Gollum dropped his head and shrank down until he was squatting on the floor shivering we doesn't know and we doesn't want to know he whimpered never came here never come again there are locked doors and closed windows in your mind and dark rooms behind them said fimir but in this I judge that you speak the truth it is well for you what oath will

          
          33:49:33
          you swear never to return and never to lead any living creature hither by word or sign must knows said Gollum with a sidelong glance at Frodo yes he knows we will promise Master if he saves us we'll promise to eat yes he crawled to Frodo's feet save us nice master he whined smeal promises to Precious promises Faithfully never come again never speak now never no precious no are you satisfied said farer yes said Frodo at least you must either accept this promise or carry out your law you'll get no more but I promised

          
          33:50:23
          that if he came to me he should not be harmed and I would not be proved faithless phir sat for a moment in thought very good he said at last I Surrender you to your master to Frodo son of Drogo let him declare what he will do with you but lord faramir said Frodo bowing you have not yet declared your will concerning the said Frodo and until that is made known he cannot shape his plans for himself or his companions your judgment was postponed until the morning but that is now at hand then I will declare my Doom said fimir as for you

          
          33:51:05
          Frodo in so far as lies in me under higher authority I declare you free in the realm of Gondor to the furthest of its ancient bands save only that neither you nor any that go with you have leave to come to this place unbitten this Dome shall stand for a year and a day and then cease unless you shall before the term come to minister tith and present yourself to the Lord and Steward of the city then I will entreat him to confirm what I have done and to make it lifelong in the meantime whomsoever you take

          
          33:51:39
          under your protection shall be under my protection and Under The Shield of Gondor are you answered Frodo bowed low I am answered he said and I place myself at your service if that is of any Worth to one so high and honorable it is of great worth said fimir and now do you take this creature this smeagle under your protection I do take smeagle under my protection said Frodo Sam sighed audibly and not at the courtesies of which as any Hobbit would he thoroughly approved in indeed in the sh such a matter would have required a

          
          33:52:18
          great many more words and Bows then I say to you said fimir turning to Gollum you are under Doom of death but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part yet if ever you be found by Any Man of Gondor astray without him the Doom shall fall and may death find you swiftly within Gondor or without if you do not well serve him now answer me with would you go you are his guide he says whether are you leading him Gollum made no reply this I will not have secret said fmir answer me or I will reverse my

          
          33:52:58
          judgment still Gollum did not answer I will answer for him said Frodo he brought me to the black gate as I asked but it was impossible there is no open gate into the nameless land said fimir seeing this we turned aside and came by the Southward Road Frodo continued for he said that there is or there may be a path near to minl Min morol said fmir I don't know clearly said Frodo but the path climbs I think up into the mountains on the Northern side of that Veil where the old city stands it goes up to a high cliff

          
          33:53:39
          and so down to that which is beyond do you know the name of that High Pass said fimir no said Frodo it is called kith unol Gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself is not that its name said fimir turning to him no said Gollum and then he squealed as if something had stabbed him yes yes we heard the name once but what does the name matter to us Master says he must get in so we must try some way there is no other way to try no no other way said fimir how do you know that and who has explored all the

          
          33:54:24
          confines of that Dark Realm he looked long and thoughtfully at Gollum presently he spoke again take this creature away unborn treat him gently but watch him and do not you smeagle try to dive into the falls the rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time leave us now and take your fish arborn went out and Gollum went cringing before him the curtain was drawn across the recess Frodo I think you do very unwisely in this said fmir I don't think you should go with this creature it's wicked no not

          
          33:55:05
          altogether Wicked said Frodo not holy perhaps said phir but malice eats it like a canker and the evil is growing he'll lead you to no good if you will part with him I'll give him safe conduct and guidance to any point on the borders of Gondor that he may name he wouldn't take it said Frodo he'd follow after me as he long has done and I've promised many times to take him under my protection and to go where he led you wouldn't ask me to break Faith with him no said fameer but my heart would for it seems less evil to counsel

          
          33:55:44
          another man to break Troth than to do so oneself especially if one sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm but no if he'll go with you you must now endure him but I don't think you are Holden to go to kirth unol of which he has told you less than he knows that much I perceived clearly in his mind don't go to kongol where then shall I go said Frodo back to the black gate and deliver myself up to the God what do you know against this place that makes its name so Dreadful nothing certain said phir we

          
          33:56:23
          of Gondor do not ever pass east of the road in these days and none of us younger men has ever done so nor has any of us set foot upon the mountains of shadow of them we know only old report and the Rumor of bygone days but there is some dark Terror that dwells in the passes above Min moral if kth is named old men and masters of law will blanch and fall silent the valley of Minas morle passed into evil very long ago and it was a menace and a dread while the banished enemy dwelt yet far away and etherion

          
          33:57:01
          was still for the most part in our keeping as you know that city was once a strong Place proud and fair Minas ethil the twin sister of our own City but it was taken by fell men whom the enemy and his first strength had dominated and who wandered homeless and masterless after his fall it is said that their Lords were men of numor who had fallen into dark wickedness to them the enemy had given rings of power and he had devoured them living ghosts they were become terrible and evil after his going they took minil

          
          33:57:38
          and dwelt there and they filled it and all the valley about with Decay it seemed empty and was not so for a shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls nine Lords there were and after the return of their Master which they aided and prepared in secret they grew strong again then the nine Riders issued forth from the gates of horor and we could not withstand them do not approach their Citadel you will be a spied it is a place of Sleepless malice full of lidless eyes do not go that way but where else will you direct me said Frodo

          
          33:58:18
          you can't yourself you say guide me to the mountains nor over them but over the mountains I'm Bound by solemn undertaking to the council to find a way or pish in the seeking and if I turn back refusing the road in its Bitter End where then shall I go among elves or men would you have me come to Gondor with this thing the thing that drove your brother mad with desire what spell would it work in minister shall there be two cities of minus morgal grinning at each other across a dead land filled with

          
          33:58:51
          rottenness I would not have it so said fimir then what would you have me do I know not only I would not have you go to death or to torment and I don't think that myth rander would have chosen this way yet since he's gone I must take such paths as I can find and there is no time for long searching said Frodo it's a hard doom and a hopeless errand said fimir but at the least remember my warning beware of this guide smeagle he's done murder before now I read it in him he sighed well so we meet and part Frodo

          
          33:59:33
          son of Drogo you have no need of soft words I don't hope to see you again on any other day under this sun but you shall go now with my blessing upon you and upon all your people rest a little while food is prepared for you I would gladly learn how this creeping smeagle became possessed of the thing of which we speak and how he lost it but I will not trouble you now if ever Beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our Tales sitting by a wall in the sun laughing at Old grief

          
          34:00:09
          you shall tell me there until that time or some other time beyond the vision of the seeing stones of numor farewell he rose and bowed low to Frodo and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave chapter 7 Journey to the crossroads Frodo and Sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a little while men bestirred themselves and The Business of the day began after a while water was brought to them and then they were led to a table where food was set for three fimir broke his fast with them he'd not slept since

          
          34:00:56
          the battle on the day before yet he didn't look weary when they'd finished they stood up may no hunger trouble you on the road said farer you have little provision but some small store of food fit for travelers I have ordered to bestowed in your packs you will have no lack of water as you walk in eilan but don't drink of any stream that flows from Imad morgal the valley of living death this also I must tell you my Scouts and Watchers have all returned even some that have crept within sight of the

          
          34:01:32
          they all find a strange thing the land is empty nothing is on the road and no sound of foot or horn or bow string is anywhere to be heard a waiting silence Bloods above the nameless land I don't know what this pretends but the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion Storm is Coming hasten while you may if you are ready let us go the sun will soon rise above the Shadow the hobbit's packs were brought to them a little heavier than they had been and also two Stout staves of polished wood shod with iron and with

          
          34:02:11
          carv and heads through which ran plattered leathern thongs I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting said fimir but take these stabes they may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild the men of the White Mountains use them though these have been cut down to your height and newly shod they are made of the fair tree lethon beloved of the wood rights of Gondor and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and returning May that virtue not only fail under the shadow into which you go the hobbits bowed low

          
          34:02:48
          most gracious host said Frodo it was said to me by elron half Elven that I should find friendship upon the way secret and unlooked for certainly I looked for No Such friendship as you have shown to have found it turns evil to great good now they made ready to depart Gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding hole and he seemed a better pleased with himself than he had been though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of faramir your guide must be blindfolded said fimir but you and your servant Sam

          
          34:03:25
          wise are release from this if you wish colum squealed and squirmed and clutched at Frodo when they came to bind his eyes and Frodo said blindfold us all three and cover up my eyes first and then perhaps you'll see that no harm is meant this was done and they were LED from the cave of HTH Anon after they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cold morning air fresh and sweet about them still blind they went on for some little time up and then gently down at last the voice of fimir ordered them to be

          
          34:04:03
          uncovered they stood under the boughs of the woods again no noise of the falls could be heard for a long Southward slope lay now between them and the Ravine in which the Stream flowed to the West they could see light through the trees as if the world came there to a sudden end at a Brink looking out Only onto the sky here is the last parting of our ways said fimir if you take my Council you will not turn Eastward yet go straight on for thus you will have the cover of the Woodland for many miles on your West

          
          34:04:39
          is an edge where the land falls into the great veils sometimes suddenly and cheer sometimes in Long hillsides keep near to this Edge and the skirts of the forest in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight I think the land dreams in a false piece and for a while all evil is withdrawn fare you well while you may he embraced the hobbits then after the manner of his people stooping and placing his hands upon their shoulders and kissing their foreheads go with the Good Will of all good men he said they bowed to the

          
          34:05:16
          ground then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away they marveled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved Vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye the forest where phir had stood seemed empty and rear as if a dream had passed fro sighed and turned back Southward as if to mask his disregard of all such courtesy Gollum was scrabbling in the mold at the foot of a tree hungry again already thought Sam well now for it

          
          34:05:55
          again have they gone at last said Gollum nasty wicked men smeagle neck still hurts him yes it does let's go yes let us go said Frodo but if you can only speak ill of those who showed you Mercy keep silent nice master said Gollum smeagle was only joking always forgives he does yes yes even nice Master's little trickes oh yes nice master nice smeagle Frodo and Sam didn't answer hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand they passed on into the woods of eilan twice that day they rested and

          
          34:06:42
          took a little of the food provided by by fameer dried fruits and salted meat enough for many days and bread enough to last while it was still fresh Gollum ate nothing the sun rose and passed overhead unseen and began to sink and the light through the trees to the West grew golden and always they walked in cool green Shadow and all about them was silence the birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb Darkness came early to the silent woods and before the fall of night they halted

          
          34:07:19
          weary for they had walked seven leagues or more from henian noon Frodo lay and slept away the night on the Deep mold beneath an ancient tree Sam beside him was more uneasy he woke many times but there was never a sign of Gollum who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night he did not say but he returned with the first glimmer of light and roused his companions must get up yes they must he

          
          34:07:54
          said long ways to go still south and east Hobbits must make haste that day passed much as the day before had gone except that the silence seemed deeper the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trees it felt as if Thunder was brewing Gollum often paused sniffing the air and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to Greater speed as the third stage of their day's March Drew on and afternoon waned the forest opened out and the trees became larger and more scattered great ilexes

          
          34:08:33
          of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide Glades with here and there among them Hoy ash trees and Giant Oaks just putting out their brown green buds about them lay long Lawns of green grass dappled with celandine and an enemies white and blue now folded for sleep and there were Acres populous with the leaves of Woodland hent already their Sleek Bell stems were thrusting through the mold no living creature Beast or bird was to be seen But in these open places Gollum grew afraid and they walked now with caution flitting from

          
          34:09:09
          one long Shadow to another light was fading fast when they came to the forest end there they sat under an old niled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling Bank a deep dim Valley lay before them on its further side the woods gathered again blue and gray under the suen evening and marched on southwards to the right the mountains of Gondor glowed remote in the west under a far flecked sky to the left lay Darkness the tower in walls of Mordor and out of that Darkness the Long

          
          34:09:47
          Valley came falling steeply in an Ever widening trough towards the andwin at its bottom ran a hurrying stream Frodo could hear its Stony voice coming up through the silence and beside it on the hither side a road went winding down like a pale ribbon down into chill gray Mists that no gleam of sunset touched there it seemed to Frodo that he described far off floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high dim tops and broken Pinnacles of old towers for lawn and dark he turned to Gollum do you know where we are he said

          
          34:10:29
          yes master dangerous places this is the road from the Tower of the Moon Master down to the ruined City by the shores of the river the ruined City yes very nasty y Place full of enemies we shouldn't have taken men's advice Hobbits have come a long way out of the path must go east now a way up there he waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains and we can't use this road oh no cruel peoples come this way down from the tower Frodo looked down onto the road at any rate nothing was moving on it now it

          
          34:11:16
          appeared lonely and forsaken running down to empty ruins in the Mist but there was an evil feeling in the air as if things might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see Frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant Pinnacles now dwindling into night and the sound of the water seemed cold and cruel the voice of morgal doin the polluted stream that flowed from the Valley of the wths what shall we do he said we've walked long and far shall we look for some place in the woods behind where we can

          
          34:11:51
          lie hidden no good hiding in the dark said Gollum it's in day that Hobbits must hide now yes indeed oh come said Sam we must rest for a bit even if we get up again in the middle of the night there'll still be hours of dark then time enough for you to take us a long march if you know the way Gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned back towards the trees working Eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood he wouldn't rest on the ground so near the evil Road and after some debate they all climbed

          
          34:12:32
          up into the crotch of a large home tree whose thick branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfortable Refuge night fell and it grew all together together dark Under The Canopy of the tree Frodo and Sam drank a little water and ate some bread and dried fruit but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep the hobbits didn't shut their eyes it must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up Suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlid gleaming at them he listened

          
          34:13:06
          and sniffed which seemed as they had noticed before his usual method of discovering the time of night are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said let's go we aren't and we haven't growled Sam but we'll go if we must Gollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree onto all fours and the hobbits followed more slowly as soon as they were down they went on again with Gollum leading eastwards up the dark sloping land they could see little for the night was now so deep that they were hardly aware of

          
          34:13:47
          the stems of trees before they stumbled against them the ground became more broken and walking was more difficult but Gollum seemed in no way troubled he led them through thickets and wastes of brambles sometimes round the lip of a deep Clift or dark pit sometimes down into Black Bush routed Hollows and out again but if ever they went a little downward always the further slope was longer ER and steeper they were climbing steadily at their first halt they looked back and they could dimly perceive the

          
          34:14:21
          roofs of the forest they had left behind lying like a vast dense Shadow a darker night under the dark blank Sky there seemed to be a great Blackness looming slowly out of the East eating up the faint blurred Stars later the sinking Moon escaped from the pursuing Cloud but it was ringed all about with a sick yellow glare at last Gollum turned to the hobbits day soon he said Hobbits must hurry not safe to stay in the open in these places make haste he quickened his pace and they followed him wearily soon

          
          34:15:03
          they began to climb up onto a great Hogback of land for the most part it was covered with a thick growth of gor and wbury and low tough thorns though here and there clearings opened the scars of recent fares the gor bushes became more frequent as they got near to the top very old and Tall they were gaunt and leggy below but thick above and already putting out yellow flowers that glimmered in the Gloom and gave a faint sweet scent so tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them passing through long

          
          34:15:38
          dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mold on the further edge of this broad Hill back they stayed their March and crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns then Twisted boughs stooping to the ground were overridden by a clamoring Maze of old bras deep inside there was a hollow hole rafted with dead branch and Bramble and roofed with the first leaves and choots of spring there they lay for a while too tired yet to eat and peering out through the holes in the cupet they watched for

          
          34:16:13
          the slow growth of day but no day came only a dead Brown Twilight in the East there was a dull red glare under the lowering Sky it was not the red of dawn across the Tumbl lands between the mountains of the Feld duath frowned at them black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away above with Jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fire glow away to their right a great shoulder of the mountain stood out dark and black amid the Shadows thrusting Westward which way do we go from here

          
          34:16:55
          asked Frodo is that the opening of of the morgal valley away over there beyond that black mass need we think about it yet said Sam surely we're not going to move anymore today if day it is perhaps not perhaps not said Gollum but we must go soon to the crossroads yes to the crossroads that's the way over there yes master the red glare over Mordor died away the Twilight deepened as great Vapors Rose in the East and crawled above them Frodo and Sam took a little food and then lay down but Gollum was

          
          34:17:41
          Restless he wouldn't eat of their food but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the bushes sniffing and muttering then suddenly he disappeared off Hunting I suppose said Sam and yawned it was his turn to sleep first and he was soon deep in a dream he thought he was back in the Bag End Garden looking for something but he had a heavy pack on his back which made him stoop it all seemed very weedy and rank somehow and thorns and Bracken would invading the beds down near the bottom Edge a job of work for me I can see but

          
          34:18:20
          I'm so tired he kept on saying presently he remembered what he was looking for my pipe he said and with that he woke up silly he said to himself as he opened his eyes and wondered why he was lying down under the Hedge it's in your pack all the time then he realized first that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf and next that he was hundreds of miles from Bag End he sat up it seemed to be almost dark why had his master let him sleep on out of turn right on till evening haven't you had no sleep Mr

          
          34:19:00
          Frodo he said what's the time seems to be getting late no it isn't said Frodo but the day is getting darker instead of lighter darker and darker as far as I can tell it isn't midday yet and you've only slept for about 3 hours I wonder what's up said Sam is there a storm coming if so it's going to be the worst there ever was we shall wish we were down a deep hole not just stuck under a hedge he listened what's that Thunder or drums or what is it I don't know said Frodo it's been going on for a good

          
          34:19:40
          while now sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seems to be the heavy air throbbing in your ears Sam looked around where's Gollum he said hasn't he come back yet no said Frodo there's not been a sign or sound of him well I can't abide him said Sam in fact I've never taken anything on a journey that I'd have been less sorry to lose on the way but it would be just like him after coming all these miles to go and get lost now just when we shall need him most that is if he's ever going to be

          
          34:20:19
          any use which I doubt you forget the marshes said froto I hope nothing has happened to him and I hope he's up to no tricks and anyway I hope he doesn't fall into other hands as you might say because if he does we shall soon be in for trouble at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again louder now and deeper the ground seemed to quiver under their feet I think we're in for trouble anyhow said Frodo I'm afraid our journey is drawing to an end maybe said Sam but where there's life there's hope as my geffer used to

          
          34:20:58
          say and need of vittles as he most ways used to add you have a bite Mr Frodo and then a bit of sleep the afternoon as Sam supposed it must be called waron looking out from the covet he could see only a done shadowless World fading slowly into a featuress colorless Gloom it felt stifling but not warm Frodo slept un quietly turning and tossing and sometimes murmuring twice Sam thought he heard him speaking Gandalf's name the time seemed to drag interminably suddenly Sam heard a hiss behind him and there was go them on all

          
          34:21:43
          fours peering at them with gleaming eyes wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered wake up no time to lose we must go yes we must go at once no time to lose Sam stared at him suspiciously he seemed frightened or excited go now watch your little game it isn't time yet it can't be tea time even least ways not inent places where there is tea time silly heed Gollum we're not in decent places time's running short yes running fast no time to lose we must go wake up Master wake up he clawed at Frodo and

          
          34:22:29
          Frodo startled out of sleep sat up Suddenly and seized him by the arm golum tore himself loose and backed away they mustn't be silly he hissed we must go no time to lose and nothing more could they get out of him where he had been and what he thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry he would not say Sam was filled with deep suspicion and showed it but Frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind he sighed hoisted his pack and prepared to go out into the ever Gathering Darkness very stealthily Gollum LED them

          
          34:23:08
          down the hillside keeping under cover wherever it was possible possible and running almost bent to the ground across any open space but the light was now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded in their gray cloaks nor heard them walking as wearily as the little people can without the crack of a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished for about an hour they went on silently in single file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute Stillness of

          
          34:23:48
          the land broken only now and again by The Faint rumbling as of Thunder far away or drum beats in some Hollow of the hills down from their hiding place they went and then turning South they steered as straight a course as Gollum could find across a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains presently not far ahead looming up like a black wall they saw a belt of trees as they drew nearer they became aware that these were of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering High though their tops were

          
          34:24:24
          gaunt and broken as if Tempest and lightning blast had swept across them but it failed to kill them or to shake their fathomless Roots the crossroads yes whispered Gollum the first words that had been spoken since they left their hiding place we must go that way turning Eastward now he led them up the slope and then suddenly there it was before them the Southward Road winding its way about the outer feet of the mountains until presently it plunged into the great Ring of trees this is the only way whispered

          
          34:25:04
          Gollum no paths beyond the road no paths we must go to the crossroads but make haste beside silent as furtively as Scouts within the campament of their enemies they crept down onto the road and stole along its Westward Edge under the Stony Bank gray as the stones themselves and soft footed as hunting cats at length they reached the trees and found that they stood in a great roofless ring open in the middle to the somber sky and the spaces between their immense bowls were like the Great Dark arches of some ruined Hall

          
          34:25:43
          in the very center four ways met behind them lay the road to the Moran before them it ran out again upon its long journey South to their right the road from old OS gillath came climbing up and Crossing passed out Eastward Into Darkness the fourth way the road they were to take standing there for a moment filled with Dread Frodo became aware that a light was shining he saw it glowing on Sam's face beside him turning towards it he saw Beyond an arch of boughs the road to aileth running almost as straight as

          
          34:26:20
          a stretched ribbon down down into the West there far away beyond sad Gondor now overwhelmed in shade the sun was sinking finding at last the Hem of the great Slow Rolling pole of cloud and falling in an ominous far towards the yet unsolid sea the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still and solemn as the great Stone Kings of argonath the years had gwed it and violent hands had maed it its head was gone and in its place was set in mockery around ruun stone rudely painted by Savage hands in the likeness of a

          
          34:27:00
          grinning face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead upon its knees and mighty chair and all about the pedestal were idle Scrolls mixed with a foul symbols that the maggot folk of Mordor used suddenly caught by the level beams Frodo saw the old King's Head it was lying rolled away by the roadside look Sam he cried startled into speech look the King has got a crown again the eyes were Hollow and the carve and beard was broken but about the high Stern fed there was a coronal of silver

          
          34:27:37
          and gold a trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the Brows as if in reverence for the Fallen King and in the crevices of his Stony hair Yellow Stone crop gleamed they cannot conquer forever said Frodo and then suddenly the brief Glimpse was gone the sun dipped and vanished and as if at the shuttering of a lamp black KN fell chapter8 the stairs of kitty thol Gollum was tugging at Frodo's cloak and hissing with fear and impatience we must go he said we mustn't stand here

          
          34:28:27
          make haste reluctantly Frodo turned his back on the west and followed as his guide led him out into the darkness of the East they left the Ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains this road too ran straight for a while but soon it began to bend away southwards until it came right under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance black and forbidding it loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind crawling under its shadow the road went on and rounding

          
          34:29:02
          it sprang East again and began to climb steeply Frodo and Sam were plotting along with heavy hearts no longer able to care greatly about about their Peril Frodo's head was bowed his burden was dragging him down again as soon as the great Crossroads had been passed the weight of it almost forgotten in ethelon had begun to grow once more now feeling the way become steep before his feet he looked wearily up and then he saw it even as golum had said that he would the city of the Ring raids he cowed against the stone

          
          34:29:43
          Bank a long tilted Valley a deep Gulf of Shadow ran back far into the mountains upon the further side someway within the Valley's arms high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the eldath stood the walls and Tower of minus morgal all was dark about it Earth and Sky but it was lit with light not the imprisoned Moonlight Welling through the marbled walls of minth long ago Tower of the Moon fair and radiant in the hollow of the hills paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow Eclipse with the light of it

          
          34:30:23
          now wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of Decay a corpse light a light that illuminated nothing in the walls and Tower window showed like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly first one way and then another a huge ghostly head learing into the night for a moment the three companions stood there shrinking staring up with unwilling eyes Gollum was the first to recover again he pulled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke no word almost he dragged

          
          34:31:06
          them forward every step was reluctant and time seemed to slow its pace so that between the raising of a foot and the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed so they came slowly to the White Bridge here the road gleaming faintly passed over the stream in the midst of the valley and went on winding deviously up towards the city's gate a black mouth opening in the Outer Circle of the Northwood walls wide Flats lay on either Bank shadowy Meades filled with pale white flowers luminous these were too

          
          34:31:45
          beautiful and yet horrible of shape like the DED forms in an uneasy dream and they gave forth a faint sickening charal smell an odor of rottenness filled the air from me to me the bridge sprang figur stood there at its head carven with conning in forms human and bestial but all corrupt and loome the water flowing beneath was silent and it steamed but the vapor that Rose from it curling and twisting about the bridge was deadly cold Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening then suddenly as if some Force

          
          34:32:26
          were at work other than his own will he began to hurry tottering forward his groping Hands Held out his head lulling from side to side both Sam and Gollum ran after him Sam caught his master in his arms as he stumbled at all almost fell right on the threshold of the bridge not that way not that way whispered Gollum but the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy Stillness like a whistle and he cowered to the ground in Terror hold up Mr Frodo muttered Sam in Frodo's ear come back not that way golum

          
          34:33:03
          says not and for once I agree with him Frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the city on the hill the Luminous Tower fascinated him and he fought the desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate at last with an effort he turned back and as he did so he felt the ring resisting him dragging at the chain about his neck and his eyes too as he looked away seemed for the moment to have been blinded the darkness before him was impenetrable Gollum crawling on the

          
          34:33:40
          ground like a frightened animal was already Vanishing into the Gloom Sam supporting and guiding his stumbling Master followed after him as quickly as he could not far from the near Bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone wall beside the road through this they passed and Sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first as the main road did until climbing above the mees of deadly flowers it faded and went dark winding its crooked way up into the northern side of the valley along this path the hobbits

          
          34:34:15
          trudged side by side unable to see Gollum in front of them except when he turned back to beckon them on then his eyes Shone with a green white light reflecting the noisome moral Sheen perhaps or kindled by some answering mood within of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path slowly they labored on as they Rose above the stench and Vapors of the poisonous stream their breath became

          
          34:34:52
          easier and their heads clearer but now their limbs were deadly tired as if they had walked all night under a burden or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of water at last they could go no further without a halt Frodo stopped and sat down on a stone they had now climbed up to the top of a great hump of bear Rock ahead of them there was a bay in the valley side and round the head of this the path went on no more than a wide ledge with a Chasm on the right across the sheer Southward face of the mountain it

          
          34:35:27
          crawled upwards until it disappeared into the Blackness above I must rest a while Sam whispered Frodo it's heavy on me Sam lad very heavy I wonder how far I can c it anyway I must rest before we venture on to that he pointed to the narrow way ahead his Gollum hurrying back to them sh his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently tugging at Frodo's sleeve he pointed towards the path but Frodo would not move not yet he said not yet weariness and more than weariness oppressed him it seemed as if

          
          34:36:09
          a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body I must rest he muttered at this gollum's fear and agitation became so great that he spoke again hissing behind his hand as if to keep the sound from unseen listeners in the air not here no not rest here fools eyes can see us when they come to the bridge they will see us come away climb climb come come Mr Frodo said Sam he's right again we can't stay here all right said Frodo in a remote voice as of one Speaking half asleep I will try wearily he got to his

          
          34:36:57
          feet but it was too late at that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath them the great rumbling noise louder than ever before rolled in the ground and echoed in the mountains then with searing suddenness they came a great red flash far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the lowering clouds with Crimson in that Valley of Shadow and cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black

          
          34:37:31
          against the UPR rushing flame in gorgoroth then came a great crack of thunder and Minas morgal answered there was a flare of livid lightnings Forks of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling Hills into the Salen clouds the Earth groaned and out of the city there came a cry mingled with harsh High voices as of birds of prey and the shrill nighing of horses wild with rage and fear there came a rending screech shivering Rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing the hobbits wheeled round

          
          34:38:08
          towards it and cast themselves down holding their hands upon their ears as the terrible cry ended falling back through a long sickening whale to silence Frodo slowly raised his head across the narrow Valley now almost on a level with his eyes the walls of the evil city stood and its cavernous gate shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide and out of the gate an army came all that host was cl in table dark as the night against the one walls and the Luminous pavement of the road Frodo

          
          34:38:48
          could see them small black figures in rank upon rank marching swiftly and silently passing outwards in an endless stream before them went a great Cavalry of Horsemen moving like ordered shadows and at their head was one greater than all the rest a rider all black save that on his hooded head he had a Helm like a crown that flickered with a petal light now he was Drawing Near The Bridge below and Frodo's staring eyes followed him unable to wink or to withdraw surely there was the lord of the nine Riders

          
          34:39:23
          returned to Earth to lead his ghastly host to battle here yes here indeed was the Haggard King whose cold hand had smitten down the ring bearer with his deadly knife the old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo's heart even as these thoughts pierced him with Dread and held him bound as with a spell the rider halted suddenly right before the entrance of the bridge and behind him all the hosts Stood Still there was a pause a dead silence maybe it was the ring that called to The Wraith Lord and for a

          
          34:40:00
          moment he was troubled sensing some other power within his Valley this way and that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear sweeping the Shadows with its unseen eyes thr waited like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to move and as he waited he felt more urgent than ever before the command that he should put on the ring but great as the pressure was he felt no inclination now to yield to it he knew that the ring would only betray him and that he had not even if he put it on the power to face the

          
          34:40:37
          morgal king not yet there was no no longer any answer to that command in his own will dismayed by Terror though it was and he felt only the beating upon Him of a great power from outside it took his hand and as Frodo watched with his mind not willing it but in suspense as if he looked on some old story far away it moved the hand inch by inch towards the chain upon his neck then his own will stirred slowly it forced the hand back and set it to find another thing a thing lying hidden near his breast cold and hard it seemed as

          
          34:41:17
          his grip closed on it the file of Galadriel so long treasured and almost forgotten till that hour as he touched it for a while all thought of the Ring was banished from his mind he sighed and bent his head at that moment The Wraith King turned and spurred his horse and rode across the bridge and All His Dark host followed him maybe the Elven hoods defied his unseen eyes and the mind of his small Enemy being strengthened had turned aside his thought but he was in haste already the hour had struck and at his great

          
          34:41:55
          Master's bidding he must march with war into the West soon he had passed like a shadow into Shadow down the winding road and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge so great an army had never issued from that Veil since the days of islor's Might no host so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the Fords of andwin and yet it was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth Frodo stirred and suddenly his heart went out to faramir the storm has burst at last he

          
          34:42:35
          thought this great array of Spears and swords is going to us gillath will f may get across in time he guessed it but did he know the hour and who can now hold the Fords when the king of the nine Riders comes and other armies will come I'm too late All Is Lost I teed on the way All Is Lost even if my errand is performed no one will ever know there will be no one I can tell it will be in vain overcome with weakness he wept and still the host of morgal crossed the the bridge then at a great distance as if it came out of memories

          
          34:43:17
          of the Sha some sunlet early morning when the day called and doors were opening he heard Sam's voice speaking wake up Mr Frodo wake up had the voice added your breakfast is ready he would hardly have been surprised certainly Sam was urgent wake up Mr Frodo they're gone he said there was a dull clang the gates of Minas morgal had closed the last rank of Spears had vanished down the road the tower still grinned across the valley but the light was fading in it the whole city was falling back into a dark broing shade

          
          34:43:59
          and silence yet still it was filled with watchfulness wake up Mr Frodo they're gone and we'd better go too there's something still alive in that place something something with eyes or a seeing mind if you take me and the longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us come on Mr Frodo Frodo raised his head and then stood up despair had not left him but the weakness had passed he even smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite that what he had to do he had to do if

          
          34:44:37
          he could and that whether fimir or Aragorn or Elon or gadil or gandaf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose he took his staff in one hand and the file in his other when he saw that the clear light was already Welling through his fingers he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart then turning from the city of morgal now no more than a gray glimmer across a dark Gulf he prepared to take the Upward Road Gollum it seemed had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness Beyond

          
          34:45:13
          when the gates of Mines morgal opened leaving the hobbits where they lay he now came creeping back his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping foolish silly he hissed make haste they mustn't think danger has pass it hasn't make haste they didn't answer but they followed him onto the climbing ledge it was little to the liking of either of them not even after facing so many other perils but it did last long soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mountain side swelled out again and there it suddenly entered a narrow

          
          34:45:49
          opening in the Rock they'd come to the first stair that Gollum had spoken of the darkness was almost complete and they could see nothing much beyond their hands stretch but gollum's eyes Shone pale several feet above as he turned back towards them careful he whispered steps lots of steps hips must be careful care was certainly needed Frodo and Sam at first felt easier having now a wall on either side but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder and as they climbed up and up they became more

          
          34:46:28
          and more aware of the long black fall behind them and the steps were narrow spaced unevenly and often treacherous they were worn and smooth at the edges and some were broken and th cracked as foot was set upon them The Hobbit struggled on until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead and forcing their aching knees to bend and straighten and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer Mountain the rocky walls Rose higher and higher above their heads at length just as they felt that

          
          34:47:04
          they could endure no more they saw gollum's eyes peering down at them again we up he was whispered first stairs ped clever Hobbits to climb so high very clever Hobbits just a few more little steps and that's all yes dizzy and very tired Sam and Frodo following him crawled up the last step and sat down rubbing their legs and knees they were in a deep dark passage that seemed still to go up before them though at a gentle slope and without steps golum did not let them rest long there's another stair still he said

          
          34:47:47
          much longer stair rest when we get to the top of next stair not yet Sam groaned longer did you say he asked yes yes longer said Gollum but not so difficult Hobbits have climbed the straight stair next comes the Winding Stair and what after that said Sam we shall see said Gollum softly oh yes we shall see I thought you said there was a tunnel said Sam isn't there a tunnel or something to go through oh yes there's a tunnel said Gollum but Hobbits can rest before they try that if they get through that they'll be nearly at the top very

          
          34:48:38
          nearly if they get through oh yeah yes Frodo shivered The Climb had made him sweat but now he felt cold and clammy and there was a chill draft in the dark passage blowing down from the invisible Heights above he got up and shook himself well let's go on he said this is no place to sit in the passage seemed to go on for miles and always the chill air flowed over them Rising as they went on to a bitter wind the mountains seemed to be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them to turn them back from the secrets of

          
          34:49:17
          the high places or to blow them away into the darkness behind they only knew that they had come to the end when suddenly they felt no wall at their right hand they could see very little great black shapeless masses and deep gray Shadows loomed above them and about them but now and again a dull red light flickered up under the lowering cloud CLS and for a moment they were aware of tall peaks in front and on either side like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof they seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet onto a

          
          34:49:54
          wide shelf a cliff was on their left and a Chasm on their right Gollum led the way close under the cliff for the present they were no longer climbing but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark and there were blocks and lump of Fallen Stone in the way their going was slow and cautious how many hours had passed since they had entered the moral Veil neither Sam nor Frodo could any longer guess the night seemed endless at length they were once more aware of a wall looming up and once more

          
          34:50:31
          a Stairway opened before them again they halted and again they began to climb it was a long and weary Ascent but this stairway did not delve into the mountain side here the huge Cliff face sloped backwards and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it at one point it crawled sideways right to the edge of the dark Chasm and Frodo glancing down saw below him as a vast deep pit the great Ravine at the head of the morgal valley down in its depths glimmered like a gloworm thread The Wraith rode from

          
          34:51:08
          the dead City to the nameless pass he turned hastily away still on and up the stairway bent and crawled until at last with a final flight short and straight it climbed out again onto another level the path had veered away from the main pass in the great Ravine and it now followed its own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser Cliff among the higher regions of the Feld duath dimly the hobbits could discern tall peers and Ja Jagged Pinnacles of stone on either side between which were great crevices and Fishes blacker than

          
          34:51:46
          the night where forgotten Winters had Ned and carved the sunless Stone and now the red light in the sky seemed stronger though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed coming to this place of Shadow or whether they saw only the flame of some great violence of sain in the torment of gorgoroth Beyond still far ahead and still high above throo looking up saw as he guessed the very crown of This Bitter Road against the suen redness of the Eastern Sky a cliff was outlined in the topmost ridge

          
          34:52:21
          narrow deep clov between two black shoulders and on either shoulder was a horn of stone he paused and looked more attentively the horn upon the left was tall and slender and in it burned a red light or else the red light in the land Beyond was shining through a hole he saw now it was a Black Tower poised above the outer pass he touched Sam's arm and pointed I don't like the look of that said Sam so this secret way of yours is guarded after all he growled turning to Gollum as you knew all along I

          
          34:53:00
          suppose always a watched yes said Gollum of course they are but Hobbits must try some way this may be least watched perhaps they've all gone away to big battle Perhaps Perhaps grunted Sam well it seems a long way off and a long way up before we get there and there's still a tunnel I think you ought to rest now Mr Frodo I don't know what time of day or night it is but we've kept going for hours and hours yes we must rest said Frodo let us find some Corner out of the wind and gather our strength for the

          
          34:53:40
          last lap but so he felt it to be the Terrors of the land Beyond and the deed to be done there seemed remote too far off yet to trouble him all his mind was bent on getting through or over this impenetrable wall and guard if once he could do that impossible thing then somehow the errand would be accomplished or so it seems to him in that dark hour of weariness still laboring in the Stony Shadows above kidol in a dark crevice between two great peers of rock they sat down Frodo and Sam a little way within and gum crouched

          
          34:54:19
          upon the ground near the opening there the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they went down into the nameless land maybe the last meal they would ever eat together some of the food of Gondor they ate and Wafers of the way bread Of The Elves and they drank a little but of their water they were sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths I wonder when we'll find water again said Sam but I suppose even over there they drink Orcs drink don't they yes they drink said Frodo but don't let

          
          34:54:57
          us speak of that such drink is not for us then all the more need to fill our bottles said Sam but there isn't any water up here not a sound or a trickle have I heard and Anyway faramir said we were not to drink any water in morgal no water flowing out of Imad morgal were his words said Frodo we not in that Valley now and if we came out on a spring it would be flowing into it and not out of it I wouldn't trust it said Sam not till I was dying of thirst there's a wicked feeling about this place he sniffed and

          
          34:55:36
          a smell I fancy do you notice it a queer kind of smell stuffy I don't like it I don't like anything here at all said Frodo step or stone breath or bone earth air and water all seem a cursed but so our path is laid yes that's so said Sam and we shouldn't be here at all if we'd known more about it before we started but I suppose it's often that way the brave things and the old tales and songs Mr Frodo adventurers as I used to call them I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out

          
          34:56:17
          and looked for because they wanted them because they were exciting and life was a bit dull a kind of sport as you might say but that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered or the ones that stay in the mind folks seem to have been just landed in them usually their paths were laid that way as you put it but I expect they had lots of chances like us of turning back only they didn't and if they had we shouldn't know because they'd have been forgotten we hear about those as just went on are

          
          34:56:52
          not all to a good end mind you at least not to what folk inside the story and not outside it call a good end you know coming home and finding things all right though not quite the same like old Mr buildo but those aren't always the best Tales to hear though they may be the best Tales to get landed in I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into I wonder said Frodo but I don't know and that's the way of a real tale take anyone that you're fond of you may know or guess what kind of a tale it is happy ending or sad ending but the

          
          34:57:31
          people in it don't know and you don't want them to no sir of course not Baron now he never thought he was going to get that Sil merel from the iron Crown in thangorodrim and yet he did and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours but that's a long tale of course and goes on past the happiness and into grief and Beyond it and the saril went on and came to AAR andil and why sir I never thought of that before we've got you've got some of the light of it in that St glass that the lady gave you why

          
          34:58:13
          to think of it we're in the same tail still it's going on don't the great Tales never end no they never end as Tales said Frodo but the people in them come and go when their part's ended our part will end later or sooner and then we can have some rest and some sleep said Sam he laughed grimly and I mean just that Mr Frodo I mean plain ordinary rest and sleep and waking up to a morning's work in the garden I'm afraid that's all I'm hoping for all the time all the big important plans are not for my sort still I wonder

          
          34:58:55
          if we shall ever be put into songs or Tales wear in one of course but I mean put into words you know told by the Fireside or read out of a great big book with red and black letters years and years afterwards and people will say let's hear about Frodo and the ring and they'll say yes that's one of my favorite stories Frodo is very brave wasn't he Dad yes my boy the famous of the hobbits and that's saying a lot it's saying a lot too much said Frodo and he laughed a long clear laugh from his heart such a sound had not been

          
          34:59:33
          heard in those places since saen came to Middle Earth to Sam suddenly it seems as if all the stones were listening on the tall rocks leaning over them but Frodo did not heed them he laughed again why Sam he said to hear you somehow makes me as mry as if the story was already written but you left out one of the chief characters Sam wise the stouthearted I want to hear more about Sam dad why didn't they put in more of his talk dad that's what I like it makes me laugh and froda wouldn't have got far

          
          35:00:08
          without Sam would he dad now Mr Frodo said Sam you shouldn't make fun I was serious so was I said Frodo and so I am we're going on a bit too fast you and I Sam are still stuck in the worst places of the story and it is all too likely that some will say at this point shut the book now Dad we don't want to read anymore maybe said Sam but I wouldn't be one to say that things done and over and made into part of the Great tals are different why even Gollum might be good in a taale better than he is to have byy

          
          35:00:48
          you anyway and he used to like Tales himself once by his own account I wonder if he thinks he's the hero or the villain Gollum he called would you like to be the hero now where has he got to again there was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near he had refused their food though he had as usual accepted a mouthful of water and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep they'd supposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day before had been to hunt for food to his own liking and

          
          35:01:25
          now he had evidently slipped off again while they talked but what for this time I don't like his sneaking off without saying said Sam and least of all now he can't be looking for food up here not unless there are some kind of Rocky fancies why there isn't even a bit of moss it's no good worrying about him now said rodo we couldn't have got so far not even within sight of the past without him and so we'll have to put up with his ways if he's false he's false old as same I'd rather have him under my

          
          35:02:01
          eye said Sam all the more so if his false do you remember he never would say if this pass was guarded or no and now we we see a tower there and it may be deserted and it may not do you think he's gone to fetch them Orcs or whatever they are no I don't think so answered Frodo even if he's up to some wickedness and I suppose that's not unlikely I don't think it's that not to Fitch Orcs or any servant of the enemy why wait till now and go through all the labor of the climb and come so near that an he fears he could probably

          
          35:02:39
          have betrayed us to walks many times since we met him now if it's anything it will be some little private trick of his own that he thinks is quite secret well I suppose you're right Mr Frodo said Sam not that it comforts me mightily I don't make no mistake I don't doubt he'd hand me over to Orcs as gladly as kissy's hand but I was forgetting is precious now I suppose the whole time it's been the precious for poor SME go that's the one idea in all his little schemes if he has any but how bringing us up here will help him in

          
          35:03:17
          that there more than I can guess very likely he can't guess himself said Frodo and I don't think he's got just one plain scheme in his muddled head I think he really is in part trying to save the precious from the enemy as long as he can for that would be the last disaster for himself too if the enemy got it and in the other part perhaps he's just biting his time and waiting on chance yes slinker and stinker as I've said before said Sam but the nearer they get to the enemy's land the more like stinker slinker will get mark my words

          
          35:03:57
          if ever we get to the pass he won't let us really take the precious thing over the Border without making some kind of trouble we haven't got there yet said Frodo no but we'd better keep our eyes till we do if we're caught napping stinker will come out on top pretty quick not but what it would be safe for us to have a wink now Master safe if you lay close to me I'd be dearly glad to see you have a sleep I keep watch over you and anyway if you lay near with my arm around you no one could come pouring

          
          35:04:33
          you without your Sam knowing it sleep said Frodo inside as if out of a desert it he had seen a mirage of cool green yes even here I could sleep sleep then Master lay your head in my lap and so Gollum found them hours later when he returned crawling and creeping down the path out of the Gloom ahead Sam sat propped against the stone his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy in his lap lay Frodo's head drowned deep in sleep upon his white foreward lay one of Sam's Brown hands and the other lay softly upon his

          
          35:05:14
          master's breast peace was in both their faces Gollum looked at them a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face The Gleam faded from his eyes and they went dim and gray old and tired a spasm of pain seemed to twist him and he turned away peering back up towards the pass shaking his head as if engaged in some interior debate then he came back and slowly putting out a trembling hand very cautiously he touched Frodo's knee but almost the touch was a Caress for a fleeting moment could one of the

          
          35:05:53
          sleepers have seen it they would have thought that they beheld an old weary Hobbit shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time Beyond friends and kin and the fields and streams of Youth and old starved pitiable thing but at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep and immediately Sam was Wide Awake the first thing he saw was Gollum pouring at Master as he thought a you he said roughly what are you up to nothing nothing said Gollum softly nice master I dare say said Sam but where

          
          35:06:34
          have you been to sneaking off and sneaking back you old villain golum withdrew himself and a green glint flickered under his heavy Lids almost spider likee he looked now crouched back on his bent limbs with his protruding eyes the fleeting moment had passed Beyond recall sneaking sneaking he hissed Hobbits always so polite yes oh nice Hobbits smeagle brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find tired he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and he guides them and he searches for paths and they say sneak sneak very nice

          
          35:07:14
          friends oh yes my precious very nice Sam felt a bit remorseful though not more trustful sorry he said I'm sorry but you startle me out of my sleep and I shouldn't have been sleeping and that made me a bit sharp but Mr Frodo he's that tired I asked him to have a wink and well that's how it is sorry but where have you been to sneaking said Gollum and the green glint did not leave his eyes oh very well said Sam have it your own way I don't suppose it's so far from the truth and now we'd better all

          
          35:07:54
          be sneaking along together what's the time is it today or tomorrow it's tomorrow said Gollum or this was tomorrow when Hobbits went to sleep very foolish very dangerous if poor smeagle wasn't sneaking about to watch I think we shall get tired of that word soon said Sam but never mind I'll wake Master up gently he smoothed the hair back from Frodo's brow and bending down spoke softly to him wake up Mr Frodo wake up Frodo stirred and opened his eyes and smiled seeing Sam's face bending over him calling me early aren't

          
          35:08:37
          you Sam he said it's dark still still yes it's always dark here said Sam but gollum's come back Mr Frodo and he says it's tomorrow so we must be walking on the last lap Frodo drew a deep breath and sat up the last lap he said hello smeagle found any food have you had any rest no food no rest nothing for smeagle said Gollum he's a snake Sam clicked his tongue but restrained himself don't take names to yourself smeel said Frodo it's unwise whether they are true or false smeagle has to take what's given him answered colum he

          
          35:09:24
          was given that name by kind Master Sam wise The Hobbit that knows so much Frodo looked at Sam yes sir he said I did use the word waking up out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand I said I was sorry but I soon sh be come let it pass then said Frodo but now we seem to have come to the point you and I smeagle tell me can we find the rest of the way by ourselves we're in sight of the pass of a way in and if we can find it now then I suppose our agreement can be said to be over you've done what you promised

          
          35:10:08
          and you're free free to go back to food and rest wherever you wish to go except to Servants of the enemy and one day I may reward you I or those that remember me no no not yet Gollum whined oh no they can't find the way themselves can they oh no indeed there's the tunnel coming smeagle must go on noest no food not yet chapter n shobs Lair it may indeed have been daytime now as Gollum said but the hobbits could see little difference unless perhaps the heavy sky above was less utterly black more like a great roof of smoke while

          
          35:11:09
          instead of the darkness of deep night which lingered still in cracks and holes a gray blurring Shadow shrouded the Stony World about them they passed on Gollum in front and the hobbits now Side by Side Up The Long Ravine between the peers and Columns of torn and weathered rock standing like huge un shapen statues on either hand there was no sound somewhere ahead a mile or so perhaps was a great gray w a last huge upth thrusting mass of Mountain Stone darker it loomed and steadily it Rose as they approached until it tired up high

          
          35:11:49
          above them shutting out the view of all that lay Beyond deep Shadow lay before its feet Sam sniffed the air H that smell he said it's getting stronger and stronger presently they were under the Shadow and there in the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave this is the way in said Gollum softly this is the entrance to the tunnel he did not speak its name Tool shobs Le out of it came a stench not the sickly odor of decay in the MS of morgal but a foul wck as if filth unnamable were piled and hoarded in the dark

          
          35:12:37
          Within is this the only way smeel said Frodo yes yes he answered yes we must go this way now do you mean to say you've been through this hole said Sam but perhaps you don't mind bad smells gollum's eyes glinted he doesn't know what we Minds does he precious no he doesn't but smeagle can bear things yes he's been through oh yes right through it's the only way and what makes the smell I wonder said Sam it's like well I wouldn't like to say some beastly hole of the Orcs I'll warrant with a 100 Years of there filth in it well said

          
          35:13:26
          Frodo Orcs or no if it's the only way we must take it drawing a deep breath they passed inside in a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark not since the lightless passages of Moria had Frodo or Sam known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denser there there were airs moving and Echoes and a sense of space here the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead they walked as it were in a black vapor rought a veritable Darkness itself that as it was breathed brought

          
          35:14:10
          blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind so that even the memory of colors and of forms and of any light faded out of thought night always had been and always would be and night was all but for a while they could still feel and indeed the senses of their feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully the walls felt to their surprise smooth and the floor safe for a step now and again was straight and even going ever up at the same stiff slope the tunnel was high and wide so wide

          
          35:14:48
          that though the hobbits walked AB breast only touching the side walls with their outstretched hands they were separated cut off alone in the darkness Gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead while they were still able to give heed to such things they could hear his breath hissing and gasp in just in front of them but after a time their senses became duller both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb and they kept on groping Walking On and On mainly by the force of the will with which they had

          
          35:15:24
          entered will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate Beyond before they had gone very far perhaps but time and distance soon passed out of his Reckoning Sam on the right feeling the wall was aware that there was an opening at the side for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less heavy and then they passed it there's more than one passage here he whispered with an effort it seemed hard to make his breath give any sound it's as orc like a place as ever there could be after that first he on the right and

          
          35:16:08
          then Frodo on on the left passed three or four such openings some wider some smaller but there was as yet no doubt of the main way for it was straight and did not turn and still went steadily up but how long was it how much more of this would they have to endure or could they endure the breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some resistance thicker than the foul air as they thrust forward they felt things brush against their heads or

          
          35:16:43
          against their hands long tentacles or hanging grows perhaps they could not tell what they were and still the stench grew it grew until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense left to them and that was for their torment 1 Hour 2 hours 3 hours how many had they pass passed in this lightless hole hours days weeks rather Sam left the tunnel side and shrank towards Frodo and their hands met and clasped and so together they still went on at length Frodo droping along the left hand Wall came suddenly to a void

          
          35:17:31
          almost he fell sideways into the emptiness here was some opening in the Rock far wider than any they had yet pass and out of it came a reek so foul and a sense of lurking malice so intense that Frodo reeled and at that moment Sam to lurched and fell forwards fighting off both the sickness and the fear froto gripped Sam's hand he said in a horse breath without voice it all comes from here the stench and the Peril now for it quick calling up his remaining strength and resolution he dragged Sam to his

          
          35:18:10
          feet and forced his own limbs to move Sam stumbled beside him one step two steps three steps at last six steps maybe they had passed the Dreadful unseen opening but whether that was so or not suddenly it was easier to move as if some hostile will for the moment had released them they struggled on still hand in hand but almost at once they came to a new difficulty the tunnel forked or so it seemed and in the dark they could not tell which was The Wider away or which kept nearer to the street which should they take the left

          
          35:18:52
          or the right they knew of nothing to guide them yet a false choice would almost certainly be fatal which way is Gollum gone panted Sam and why didn't he wait smigle said Frodo trying to call smig Eagle but his voice croaked and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips there was no answer not an echo not even a Tremor of the air he's really gone this time I fancy muted Sam I guess this is just exactly where he meant to bring us colum If Ever I lay hands on you again you'll be sorry for it presently groping and fumbling in

          
          35:19:35
          the dark they found that the opening on the left was blocked either it was a blind or else some great Stone had fallen in the passage this can't be the way freder whispered right or wrong we must take the other and quick Sam pented there's something worse than Gollum about I can feel something looking at us they had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a sound startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence a gurgling bubbling noise noise and a long venomous hiss they wheeled round but nothing could be seen

          
          35:20:14
          still as Stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know what it's a trap said Sam and he laid his hold upon the hilt of his sword and as he did so he thought of the darkness of the battle when it came I wish old Tom was near us now he thought then as he stood Darkness about him and a Blackness of Despair and anger in his heart it seemed to him that he saw a light a light in his mind almost unbearably bright at first as a Sunray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit then the light became color green gold

          
          35:20:55
          silver white far off as in a little picture drawn by Elven fingers he saw the lady gadriel standing on the grass in lauan and Gifts were in her hands and you ringbearer he heard her say remote but clear for you I have prepared this the bubbling hiss Drew nearer and there was a creaking as of some great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark AR came on before it master master cried Sam and the life and urgency came back into his voice the lady's gift the starg glass A light to you in Dark Places she said at was to be

          
          35:21:39
          the Star Glass the Star Glass muttered Frodo as one answering out of sleep hardly comprehending why yes why had I forgotten it a light when all other lights go out and now indeed light alone can help us slowly his hand went to his bosom and slowly he held aoft the file of Galadriel for a moment it glimmered faint as a rising star struck strugling in heavy earthward Mists and then as its power waxed and hope grew in Frodo's mind it began to burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart of dazzling

          
          35:22:21
          light as though ail had himself come down from the high Sunset paths with the last silmaril upon his brow the darkness receded from it until it seemed to shine in the center of a globe of Airy Crystal and the hand that held it sparkled with white far Frodo gazed in Wonder at this marvelous gift that he had so long carried not guessing its full worth and potency seldom had he remembered it on the road until they came to moral Veil and never had he used it for fear of its Revealing [Music] Light he cried and knew not what he had

          
          35:23:06
          spoken for it seemed that another voice spoke through his clear untroubled by the foul air of the pit but are potencies there are in Middle earth powers of night and they are old and strong and she that walked in the darkness had heard the elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time and she had not heeded it and it did not daunt her now even as Frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent upon him and a deadly regard considering him not far down the tunnel between them and the opening where they had reeled and

          
          35:23:45
          stumbled he was aware of eyes growing visible two great clusters of many windowed eyes the coming Menace was unmasked at last the radiance of the Star Glass was broken and thrown back from their thousand facets but behind the glitter a pale deadly fire began steadily to Glow within a flame kindled in some deep pit of evil thought monstrous and abominable eyes they were bestial and yet filled with purpose and with Hideous Delight gloating over their prey trapped beyond all hope of Escape Frodo and Sam horror stricken

          
          35:24:25
          began slowly to back away their own gaze held by the Dreadful stare of those baleful eyes but as they backed so the eyes Advanced Frodo's hand wavered and slowly the file drooped then suddenly released from the holding spill to run a little while in vain Panic for the amusement of the eyes they both turned and fled together but even as they ran Frodo looked back and saw with Terror that at once the eyes came leaping up behind the stench of death was like a cloud about him stand stand he cried desperately running is no use

          
          35:25:03
          slowly the eyes crept nearer gadriel he called and ga in his courage he lifted up the file once more the eyes halted for a moment there guard relaxed as if some hint of Doubt troubled him then Frodo's heart flamed within him and without thinking what he did whether it was folly or despair or courage he took the file in his left hand and with his right hand drew his sword sting flashed out and the sharp Elven blade sparkled in the silver light but at its edges a blue fire flicked then holding the star

          
          35:25:39
          Aloft and the bright sword Advanced Frodo Hobbit of the Sha walked steadily down to meet the eyes they wavered doubt came into them as the light approached one by one they dimmed and slowly they drew back no brightness so deadly had ever Afflicted them before from sun and moon and star they had been safe underground but now a star had descended into the very Earth still it approached and the eyes began to Quail one by one they all went dark they turned away and a great bulk beyond the light's reach heaved its huge shadow

          
          35:26:21
          in between they were gone master master cried Sam he was close behind his own sword drawn and ready stars and Glory but the elves would make a song of that if ever they heard of it and may I live to tell them and hear them sing but don't go on Master don't go down to that Den now's our only chance now let's get out of this foul hole and so back they turned once more first walking and then running for as they went the floor of the tunnel Rose steeply and with every stride they clambered higher above the stenches of

          
          35:27:02
          the Unseen Lair and strength returned to Limb and heart but still the hatred of The Watcher lurked behind them blind for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent on death and now there came a flow of air to meet them cold and thin the opening the tunnels end at last it was before them panting yearning for a ruthless place they flung themselves forward and then amazement they staggered tumbling back the outlet was blocked with some barrier but not of stone soft and a little yielding it seemed and

          
          35:27:42
          yet strong and impervious air filtered through but not a glimmer of any light once more they charged and were H back holding aoft the file froo looked and before him he saw a greyness which the radiance of the Star Glass did not Pierce and did not illuminate as if it were a shadow that being cast by No Light No Light could dissipate across the wiip height of the tunnel a vast web was spun orderly as the web of some huge spider but denser woven and far greater and each thread was as thick as rope Sam laughed

          
          35:28:21
          grimly cobwebs he said is that all cobwebs but what a spider have at them down with them in a fury he hued at them with his sword but the thread that he struck did not break it gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bow string turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm three times Sam struck with all his force and at last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped and twisted curling and whipping through the air one end of it lashed Sam's hand and he cried out in pain starting back and drawing

          
          35:29:01
          his hand across his mouth it'll take days to clear the road like this he said what's to be done done of those eyes come back no not to be seen said rodo but I still feel that they're looking at me or thinking about me making some other plan perhaps if this light were lowered if it failed they would quickly come again trapped in the end said Sam bitterly his anger Rising again above weird and despair nuts in a net may the curse of faramir bite that Gollum and biting quick that would not help us now said Frodo come

          
          35:29:41
          let's see what sting can do it is an Elven blade there were webs of H in the dark Ravines of beleriand where it was forged but you must be the guard and hold back the eyes here take the Star Glass Don't Be Afraid hold it up and watch then Frodo stepped up to the great gray net and healed it with a wide sweeping stroke drawing the bitter Edge Swift across a ladder of close strung cords and at once springing away the blue gleaming blade Shore through them like a side through grass and they leapt and red and then hung loose a great rent

          
          35:30:21
          was made Stoke after stroke he dealt until at last all the web within his reach was shattered and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil in the incoming wind the Trap was broken come cried Frodo on on wild Joy at their escape from the very mouth of Despair suddenly filled all his mind his head world as with a draft of potent wine he sprang out shouting as he came it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through the den of night the great smokes had risen and grown thinner

          
          35:31:00
          and the last hours of a somber day were passing the red glare of Mordor had died away in suen Gloom yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a Mourning of sudden hope almost he had reached the summit of the wall only a little higher now the Clift kongol was before him a dim notch in the Black Ridge on the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side a short race a sprinter's course and he would be through the passam he cried not heeding the shrillness of his voice that released from the choking Airs of the

          
          35:31:38
          tunnel rang out now high and wild the pass run run and we'll be through through before anyone can stop us Sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs but glad as he was to be free he was uneasy and as he ran he kept on glancing back at the dark arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or some shape Beyond his imagining spring out in Pursuit too little did he or his master know of The Craft of sheep elob she had many exits from her Lair there agong she had dwelt an evil thing in spider form even such as once

          
          35:32:21
          of old had lived in the land of the elves in the west that is now Under the Sea such as Baron fought in the mountains of Tera in Dorth and so came to Luan upon the green sword amid the hemlocks in the Moonlight long ago how Shob came there flying from ruin no tale tells for out of the dark years few Tales have come but still she was there who was there before Sauron and before the first stone of bad dur and she served none but herself drinking The Blood of Elves and Men bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts

          
          35:33:01

          her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside him cutting him off from light and from regret and he had promised to bring her food but her lust was not his lust little she knew of or cared for Towers or Rings or anything devised by mind or hand who only desired death for all others mind and body and for herself a glut of life alone swollen till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the Darkness could not contain her but that desire was yet far away and long now had she been hungry lurking in

          her Den while the power of saon grew and light and living things forsook his borders and the City in the valley was dead and no Elf or man came near only the unhappy Orcs poor food and wey but she must eat and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever she found some way to snare them but she lusted for sweeter meat and golum had brought it to her we'll see we'll see he said often to himself when the evil mood was on him as he walked the dangerous road from Emin

          that it was a burden to him to run and his feet seemed Leen dread was round him and enemies before him in the pass and his master was in a fay mood running heedlessly to meet them turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and the Deep Gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked ahead and he saw two things that increased his dismay he saw that the sword which Frodo still held un sheathed was glittering with blue flame and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark still the window in the tower was glowing

          
          35:37:52
          red Orcs he muttered we'll never rush it like this there's Orcs about and worse than Orcs then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy he closed his hand about the precious file which he still bore read with his own living blood his hand Shone for a moment and then he thrust the Revealing Light deep into a pocket near his breast and Drew his Elven cloak about him now he tried to Quicken his Pace his master was gaining on him already he was some 20 strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he

          
          35:38:27
          would be lost to sight in that gray World hardly had Sam hidden the light of the Star Glass when she came a little way ahead and took to his left he saw suddenly issuing from a black hole of Shadow under the cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream most like a spider she was but huger than the great hunting beasts and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes those same eyes that he had thought daunted and

          
          35:39:06
          defeated there they were it with a fell light again clustering in her outthrust head Great Horn she had and behind her short stalk-like neck was a huge swollen body a vast bloated bag swaying and sagging between her legs its great bulk was black blotched with livid marks but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stench her legs were were bent with great knobbed joints high above her back and hairs that stuck out like steel spines and at each leg's end there was a claw as soon as she had squeezed her

          
          35:39:51
          soft squelching body and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from her Lair she moved with a horrible speed now running on her creaking legs now making a sudden bound she was between Sam and his master either she did not see Sam or she avoided him for the moment as the bearer of the light and fixed all her intent upon one Prey Upon Frodo B of his file running heedless up The Path unaware yet of his Peril swiftly he ran but sheab was swifter in a few leaps she would have him Sam gasped and gathered

          
          35:40:29
          all his remaining breath to shout look out behind he yelled look out master I'm but suddenly his cry was stifled a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the neck while something wrapped itself about his leg taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker got him heed Gollum in his ear at last my precious we've got him yes the nasty Hobbit we takes this one she'll get the other oh yes sheab will get him not smeagle he promised he won't hurt Master at all but he's got you you nasty filthy

          
          35:41:13
          little sneak he spat on Sam's neck Fury at the treachery and Desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly Peril gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid Hobbit as he thought him not Gollum himself could have Twisted more quickly or more fiercely his hold on Sam's mouth slipped and Sam ducked and lunged forward again trying to tear away from the grip on his neck his sword was in his hand and on his left arm hanging by its thong was

          
          35:41:52
          phia's staff desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy but Gollum was too quick his long right arm shot out and he grabbed Sam's wrist his fingers were like a vice slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down down and forward till with a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground and all the while gollum's other hand was tightening on Sam's throat then Sam played his last trick with all his strength he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted then suddenly he drove his legs against the

          
          35:42:27
          ground and with his whole Force hurled himself backwards not expecting even this simple trick from Sam Gollum fell over with Sam on top and he received the weight of the sturdy Hobbit in his stomach a sharp hiss came out of him and for a second his hand upon Sam's throat loosened but his finger still gripped the sword hand Sam tore himself forward and away and stood up and then quickly he wheeled about to his right pivoted on the wrist held by Gollum laying hold of the staff with his left hand Sam swung

          
          35:43:01
          it up and down it came with a whistling crack on gollum's outstretched arm just below the elbow with a squeal Gollum let go then Sam waded in not waiting to change the staff from left to right he dealt another Savage blow quick as a snake Golem slithered aside and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his back the staff cracked and broke that was enough for him grabbing from behind was an old game of his and seldom had he failed in it but this time miss L by Spite he had made the mistake of speaking and

          
          35:43:41
          gloating before he had both hands on his victim's neck everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan since that horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness and now he was face to face with a furious enemy little less than his own size this fight was not for him Sam swept up his sword from the ground and raised it golum squealed and and springing aside onto all fours he jumped away in one big bound like a frog before Sam could reach him he was off running with amazing speed back towards the

          
          35:44:18
          tunnel sword in hand Sam went after him for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the Red Fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum but before he could overtake him Gollum was gone then as the dark hole stood before him and the stench came out to meet him him like a clap of Thunder the thought of Frodo and the monster smote upon Sam's mind he spun round and rushed wildly up The Path calling and calling his master's name he was too late so far gollum's plot had succeeded chapter [Music]

          10 the choices of Master Sam wise froda was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over him so a tent upon her victim that she took no heed of Sam and his cries until he was close at hand as he rushed up he saw that Frodo was already Bound in cords wound about him from ankle to shoulder and the monster with a great for legs was beginning half to lift half to drag his body away on the near side of him lay gleaming on the ground his Elven blade where it had fallen useless from his

          
          35:45:43
          grasp Sam did not wait to wonder what was to be done or whether he was Brave or loyal or filled with rage he sprang forward with a yell and seized his master sword in his left hand then he charged no Onslaught more Fierce was ever seen in the Savage world of Beasts where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth alone Will Spring upon a tower of horn and hide its Sands above its Fallen mate Disturbed as if out of some gloating Dream by his small yell she turned slowly the Dreadful malice of her

          glance upon him but almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless years The Shining sword bit upon her foot and Shore away the claw Sam sprang in inside the arches of her legs and with a quick up thrust of his other hand stabbed at the clustered Eyes Upon her lowered head one great eye went dark now the miserable creature was right under her for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws her vast belly was above him with its putrid light and the stench of it almost

          
          35:46:58
          smok him down still his Fury held for one more blow and before she could sink upon Him smothering him and all his little impudence of Courage he slashed the bright Elven blade across her with desperate strength but Shob was not as dragons are no softer spot had she save only her eyes knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age old hide but ever thickened from within with layer on layer of eval growth the blade scored it with a dreadful gash but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of

          
          35:47:38
          men not though Elf or dwarf should Forge the steel or the hand of Baron or of toin wield it she yielded to the stroke and then heaved up the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head pois and froed and bubbled from the wound now spaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again too soon for Sam still stood upon his feet and dropping his own sword with both hands he held the Elven blade Point upwards fending off that ghastly roof and so Shob with a driving force of her own cruel will with

          
          35:48:19
          strength greater than any Warrior's hand thrust herself upon a bitter Spike deep deep it pricked as Sam was crushed slowly to the ground no such anguish had sheilo ever known or dreamed of knowing in all her long world of wickedness not the DTI soldier of old Gondor nor the most Savage orc ENT trapped had ever thus endured her or set blade to her beloved flesh a shadow went through her heaving up again wrenching away from the pain she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive

          
          35:49:01
          leap Sam had fallen to his knees by Frodo's head his senses reeling in the foul St his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword through the Mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of Frodo's face and stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the Swoon that was upon Him slowly he raised his head and saw her only a few Paces away eyeing him her beak dabbling a spittle of Venom and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye there she crouched her shattering belly

          
          35:49:35
          sple upon the ground the great bows of her legs quivering as she gathered herself for another spring this time to crush and sting to death no little bite of poison to steal the struggling of her meat this time to slay and then to Rend even as Sam himself crouched looking at her seeing his death in her eyes a thought came to him as if some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled in his breast with his left hand and found what he sort cold and hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror the file of

          
          35:50:15
          Galadriel Galadriel he said faintly and then he heard voices far off but clear the crying of the elves as they walked under the stars in The Beloved Shadows of the sh and the music of the elves as it came through his sleep in the Hall of fire in the house of el Kil thel elberth and then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which he did not know I elil fuos and with that he staggered to his feet and was Sam wise The Hobbit hamfast son again now come you filth he cried you've hurt my Master you brute and

          
          35:51:08
          you'll pay for it we're going on but we'll settle with you first come on and tist it again as if his indomitable Spirit had set its potency in motion the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand it flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament Sears the dark air with intolerable Light No Such Terror Out of Heaven had ever burned in shelob's face before the beams of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain and the Dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye she fell back

          
          35:51:46
          beating the air with her for legs her sight blasted by Inner Lightnings her mind in agony then turning her maimed head away she rolled aside and began to crawl claw by claw towards the opening in the dark Cliff behind Sam came on he was reeling like a drunken man but he came on and Shob cowed at last shrunken in De feat jerked and quivered as she tried to hasten from him she reached the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail of green yellow slime she slipped in even as Sam hued a last stroke at her dragging legs then he

          
          35:52:26
          fell to the ground Shob was gone and whether she lay long in her Lair nursing her malice and her Miser and in slow years of Darkness healed herself from within rebuilding her clustered eyes until with Hunger like death she spun once more her Dreadful snares in the Glens of the mountains of Shadow this tale does not tell Sam was left alone wearily as the evening of the nameless land fell upon the place of battle he crawled back to his master master dear Master he said but Frodo did not speak as he had run

          
          35:53:09
          forward eager rejoicing to be free sheilo with Hideous speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck he lay now pale and heard no voice and did not move Master dear Master said Sam and through a long silence waited listening in vain then as quickly as he could he cut away The Binding cords and laid his head upon Frodo's breast and to his mouth but no Stir of life could he find nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart often he chafed his master's hands and feet and touched his brow but all were

          
          35:53:54
          cold Frodo Mr Frodo he called don't leave me here alone it's your Sam calling don't go where I can't follow wake up Mr Frodo oh wake up froo me dear me dear wake up then anger surged over him and he ran about his master's body in a rage stabbing the air and smiting the stones and shouting Challengers presently he came back and bending looked at Frodo's face pale beneath him in the Dusk and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was revealed to him in the mirror of gadriel in lauan fro with a pale face lying fast

          
          35:54:38
          asleep under a great dark Cliff or fast asleep he had thought then he's dead he said not asleep dead and as he said it as if the words had set the Venom to its work again it seemed to him that the heue of the face grew livid green and then black despair came down on him and Sam bowed to the ground and threw his gry hood over his head and night came into his heart and he knew no more when at last the Blackness passed Sam looked up and shadows were about him but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he could not

          
          35:55:26
          tell he was still in the same place and still his master lay beside him dead the mountains had not crumbled nor the Earth fallen into to ruin what shall I do what shall I do he said did I come all this way with him for nothing and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that at the time he did not understand himself at the beginning of their journey I have something to do before the end I must see it through sir if you understand but what can I do not leave Mr Frodo dead un buried on the top of

          
          35:56:09
          the mountains and go home or go on go on he repeated and for a moment doubt and fear shook him go on is that what I've got to do and leave him then at last he began to weep and going to Frodo he composed his body and folded his cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his CL spoke about him and he laid his own sword at one side and the staff that faramir had given at the other if I'm to go on he said then I must take your sword by your leave Mr Frodo but I'll put this one to lie by you as it lay by the old King in the

          
          35:56:56
          Barrow and you've got your beautiful mythal coat from old Mr Bilbo and your Star Glass Mr Frodo you did lend it to me and I'll need it where I'll be always in the dark now it's too good for me and the lady gave it to you but maybe she'd understand do you understand Mr Frodo I've got to go on buty could not go not yet he knelt and held Frodo's hand and could not release it and time went by and still he knelt holding his Master's Hand and in his heart keeping a debate now he tried to find strength to tear

          
          35:57:40
          himself away and go on a lonely Journey for vengeance if once he could go his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world pursuing until he had him at last Gollum then Gollum would die in a corner but that was not what he had set out to do it would not be worthwhile to leave his master for that it would not bring him back nothing would they had better both be dead together and that too would be a lonely Journey he looked on the bright point of the sword he thought of the places behind where there was a black Brink and

          
          35:58:21
          an empty fall into nothingness there was no Escape that way that was to do nothing not even to grieve that was not what he had set out to do what am I to do then he cried again and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer see it through another lonely journey and the worst what me alone go to the crack of Doom and all he quailed still but the resolve grew what me take the ring from him the council gave it to him but the answer came at once and the council gave him companions so that the errand should not fail and

          
          35:59:11
          you are the last of all the company the errand must not fail I wish I wasn't the last he groaned I wish old gandal was here or somebody why am I left all alone to make up my mind I'm sure to go wrong and it's not for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward but you haven't put yourself forward you've been put forward and as for not being the right and proper person why Mr Frodo wasn't as you might say nor Mr Bilbo they didn't choose themselves oh well I must make up my own mind I will make it up but I'll be sure

          
          35:59:54
          to go wrong that would be Sam gamji all over let me see now if we're found here or Mr Frodo's dead and the things on him well the enemy will get it and that's the end of all of us of laurian and rivendel and the Shire and all and there's no time to lose or it'll be the end anyway the war's begun and more than likely things are all going the enemy's way already no chance to go back with it and get advice or permission no it's sit here till they come and kill me over Master's body and gets it or take it and

          
          36:00:32
          go he drew a deep breath then take it it is he stooped very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand inside Frodo's tunic then with his other hand raising the head he kissed the cold forehead and softly drew the chain over it and then the head laid quietly back again in rest no change came over the still face and by that more than by all other tokens Sam was convinced at asked that Frodo had died and laid aside the quest goodbye Master my dear he murmured forgive you Sam he'll come back to this

          
          36:01:17
          spot when the job's done if he manages it and then he'll not leave you again rest you quiet till I come and may no foul creature come Andy you and if the lady could hear me and give me one wish I would wish to come back and find you again goodbye and then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it and at once his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring as if a great Stone had been strung on him but slowly as if the weight became less or new Strength grew in him he raised his head and then with

          
          36:01:54
          a great effort got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden and for a moment he lifted up the file and looked down at his master and the light burned gently now now with the soft Radiance of the evening star in summer and in that light Frodo's face was fair of hue again pale but beautiful with an Elish Beauty as of one who is long past the shadows and with a bitter comfort of that last sight Sam turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark he had not far to go the tunnel was

          
          36:02:34
          some way behind the a cleft a couple of hundred yards ahead or less the path was visible in the dusk a deep rut worn in ages of Passage running now gently up in a long trough with Cliffs on either side the trough narrowed rapidly soon Sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps now the orc Tower was right above him frowning black and in it the red eye glowed now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it he was coming to the top of the steps and was in The Cliff at last I've made up my mind he kept saying

          
          36:03:14
          to himself but he had not though he'd done his best to think it out what he was doing was all together against the grain of his nature have I got it wrong he muttered what ought I to have done as the sheer sides of the cliff closed about him before he reached the actual Summit before before he looked at last on the path descending into the nameless land he turned for a moment motionless and intolerable doubt he looked back he could still see like a small blot in the Gathering Gloom the mouth of the tunnel and he thought he

          
          36:03:53
          could see or guess where Frodo lay he fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down there or perhaps it was some trick of his tears as he peered out of that high Stony place where all his life had fallen in ruin if only I could have my wish my one wish he sighed to go back and find him then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few steps the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken only a few steps and now only a few more and he would be going down and would never see that high place

          
          36:04:33
          again and then suddenly he heard cries and voices he stood still as a stone orc voices they were behind him and before him a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts Orcs were coming up to the cliff From The Far Side from some entry to the tower perhaps tramping feet and shots behind he wheeled round he saw small red lights torches winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel at last the hunt was up the red eye of the tower had not been blind he was caught now the flicker of approaching

          
          36:05:12
          torches and the clink of Steel ahead was very near in a minute they would reach the top and be on him he had taken too long in making up his mind and now it was no good how could he escape or save himself or save the Ring The Ring he was not aware of any thought or decision he simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the ring in his hand the head of the orc company appeared in the cliff right before him then he put it on the world changed and a single moment of time was filled with an hour of

          
          36:05:48
          thought at once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was dimmed but otherwise than in shelob's Lair all things about him now were not dark but vague while he himself was there in a gray hazy world alone like a small black Solid Rock and the ring weighing down his left hand was like an orb of hot gold he did not feel invisible at all but horribly and uniquely visible and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him he heard the crack of stone and the murmur of water far off in morgal Veil

          
          36:06:29
          and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of Shob groping lost in some blind passage and voices in The Dungeons of the Tower and the cries of the Orcs as they came out of the tunnel and deafening roaring in his ears the crash of the feet and the rending clamor of the Orcs before him he shrank against the cliff but they marched up like a phantom company gray distorted figures in a Mist only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands and they passed him by he cowed trying to creep away

          
          36:07:05
          into some cranon to hide he listened the Orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had cited one another and both parties were now hurrying and trouting he heard them both clearly and he understood what they said perhaps the ring gave understanding of tongues or simply understanding especially of the Servants of sa and its maker so that if he gave heed he understood and translated the thought to himself certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it approached the places of its forging but one thing it did not confer

          
          36:07:44
          and that was courage at present Sam still thought only of hiding of lying low till all was quiet again and he listened anxiously he could not tell how near the voices were the word seemed almost in his ears Ola goag what are you doing up here had enough of War already orders you lber and what are you doing shagrat tired of lurking up there thinking of coming down to fight orders to you I'm in command of this pass so speak civil what your report nothing I I no a yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders the Orcs lower

          
          36:08:30
          down had suddenly seen something they began to run so did the others hey h here's something lying right in the road a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarling horns and a babble of Bain voices with a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood they had seen his master what would they do he had heard tales of the Orcs to make the blood run cold it could not be borne he sprang up he flung The Quest and all his decisions away and fear and doubt with them he knew knew now where his place was and had been at his master's side

          
          36:09:10
          though what he could do there was not clear back he ran down the steps down the path towards Frodo how many are there he thought 30 or 40 from the tower at least and a lot more than that from down below I guess how many can I kill before they get me they'll see the flame and the sword as soon as I drew it and they'll get me sooner or later I wonder if any s s will ever mention it how Sam wise fell in the high pass and made a wall of bodies around his master No No Song of course not for the ring will be found and

          
          36:09:46
          there'll be no more songs I can't help it my place is by Mr Frodo they must understand that El Ron and the council and the great Lords and Ladies with all their wisdom their plans have gone wrong I can't be their ring bearer not without Mr Frodo but the walks were out of his dim sight now he had had no time to consider himself but now he realized that he was weary weary almost to exhaustion his legs would not carry him as he wished he was too slow the path seemed miles long where had they all got to in the

          
          36:10:25
          Mist there they were again a good way ahead still a cluster of figures around something lying on the ground a few seemed to be darting this way and that bent like dogs on a trail he tried to make a spurt come on Sam he said or you'll be too late again he loosened the sword in his cheath in a minute he would draw it and then there was a wild clamor hooting and laughing as something was lifted from the ground yeah up up then a voice shouted now off the quick way back to the undergate she'll not trouble us tonight by all the

          
          36:11:06
          signs the whole band of orc figures began to move four in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders they had taken Frodo's body they were off he could not catch them up still he labored on the Orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in those were the burden were first and behind them there was a good deal of struggling and jostling Sam came on he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his wavering hand but they did not see it even as he came panting up the last of them vanished into the black

          
          36:11:46
          hole for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast then he drew his sleeve across his face wiping away the grime and sweat and tears curse the filth he said and sprang after them into the darkness it no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel rather it was as if he had stepped out of a thin Mist into a heavier fog his weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more he thought he could see the light of torches a little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up Orcs go

          
          36:12:25
          fast in tunnels and this tunnel they knew well for in spite of Shob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from the dead City over the mountains in what far off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made where Shob had taken up her Abode in ages past they did not know but many byways they had delved about in on either side so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters tonight they did not intend to go far down but were hastening to find a side passage

          
          36:13:01
          that led back to their Watchtower on the cliff most of them were gleeful delighted with what they had found and seen and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the fashion of their kind Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices flat and hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two voices from among all the rest they were louder and nearer to him the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing up the rear debating as they went Can't you stop your Rebel making such a record shagrat grunted the one we

          
          36:13:37
          don't want Shob on us go on Gag yours are making more than half the noise said the other but let the lads play no need to worry about Shob for a bit I reckon she's sat on a nail it seems and we Shan cry about that didn't you see a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers if we've stopped it once we've stopped it a 100 times so let them laugh and we've struck a bit of luck at last got something that l b wants l b wants it eh what is it do you think Elish it look to me but undersized

          
          36:14:17
          what's the danger in a thing like that don't know till we've had a look oh so they haven't told you what to expect they don't tell us all they know do they not by half but they can make mistakes even the top ones can Shh go back shagrat voice was lowered so that even with his strangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just catch what was said they may but they've got eyes and ears everywhere some among my lot as like as not but there's no doubt about it they're troubled about something the nasal down below are by your account and

          
          36:14:58
          look bores too something's nearly slipped nearly you say said goag all right said shagrat but we'll talk of that later wait till we get to the underway there's a place there where we can talk a bit while the lads go on shortly afterwards Sam saw the Torches disappear then there was a rumbling noise and just as he hurried up a bump as far as he could guess the Orcs had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo and he had tried and found blocked it was still blocked there seemed to be a great Stone in the way

          
          36:15:36
          but the Orcs had got through somehow for he could hear their voices on the other side they were still running along deeper and deeper into the mountain back towards the tower Sam felt desperate they were carrying off his master's body for some foul purpose and he could not follow he thrust and pushed at the Block and he threw himself against it but it did not yield then not far inside or so he thought he heard the two captains voices was talking again he stood still listening for a while hoping

          
          36:16:09
          perhaps to learn something useful perhaps gorbag who seemed to belong to Min morgal would come out and he could then slip in no I don't know said gags voice the messages go through quicker than anything could fly as a rule but I don't inquire how it's done safest not to girl those nasal give me the creeps and they skin the body off you as soon as look at you and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side but he likes them there is favorites nowadays so it's no use grumbling I tell you it's no game serving down in the

          
          36:16:51
          city you should try being up here with Shob for company said shagrat I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of them but the war's on now and when that's over things may be easier it's going well they say they would grunted gorbag we'll see but anyway if it does go well there should be a lot more room what do you say if we get a chance you and me will slip off and sit up somewhere on our own with a few trusty Lads somewhere where there's good loot nice and handy and no big bosses uh said shret like old times yes

          
          36:17:35
          said gorbag but don't count on it I'm not easy in my mind as I said the big bosses his voice sank almost to a whisper I even the biggest can make mistakes something nearly slipped you say I say something has slipped and we've got to look out always the poor ooks to put slips right and small thanks but don't forget the enemy don't love us any more than they love him and if they get top sides on him we're done for but see here when were you ordered out about an hour ago just before you saw us a message came nazul uneasy spies feared

          
          36:18:21
          on stairs double vigilance Patrol to head of stairs I came at once Bad Business said gag see here our silent Watchers were uneasy more than 2 days ago that I know but my patrol wasn't ordered out for another day nor any message sent to L BS either oh to the great signal going up and the H nasal going off to the war and all that and then they couldn't get L BS to pay attention for a good while I'm told the eye was busy elsewhere I suppose said shagrat big things going on away West they say I dare say growled

          
          36:19:04
          gorbag but in the meantime enemies have got up the stairs and what were you up to you're supposed to keep watch aren your special orders or no what are you for that's enough don't try and teach me my job we will awake all right we knew there were funny things going on very funny yes very funny lights and shouting and all but she love was on the go my lad saw her and her sneak h sneak what's that you must have seen him little thin black fellow like a spider himself or perhaps more like a starved frog he's

          
          36:19:45
          been here before came out of lugs the first time years ago and we had word from high up to let him pass he's been up the stairs once or twice since then but we've left him alone seems to have some understanding with her ladyship I suppose he's no good to eat she wouldn't worry about words from high up but a fine guard you keep in the valley he was up here a day before all this racket early last night we saw him anyway my Lads reported that her ladyship was having some fun and that seemed good enough for me until the

          
          36:20:24
          message came I thought her sneak had brought her a toy or that you'd perhaps sent her a present a prisoner of war or something I don't interfere when she's playing nothing gets by she love when she's on the hunt nothing say you didn't you use your eyes back there I tell you I'm not easy in my mind whatever came up the stairs did get by it cut her web and got clean out of the hole that's something to think about oh well but she got him in the end didn't she got him got who this little fell but if he was the only one then she'd

          
          36:21:08
          had him off to her ladder long before and there he'd be now and if L Bo wanted him you'd have to go and get him nice for you but there was more than one at this point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear against the stone oh cut the cord she'd put around him shagrat same one has cut the web didn't you see that and who stuck uping into her lady ship same one I reckon and where's he where is he shagrat shagrat made no reply you may well put your thinking cap on if you've got one it's no laughing matter no one

          
          36:21:49
          no one has ever stuck a pit in Shob before as you should know well enough there's no grief in that but think as someone Loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned Rebel That Ever Walked since the bad old times since the great Siege something has slipped and what is it then growled shagr by all the signs Captain shagr I'd say there's a large Warrior loose elf most likely with an elf's sword anyway and an axe as well maybe and he's loosing your bounds too and you've never spotted him very funny indeed gag SP Sam

          
          36:22:35
          smiled grimly at this description of himself oh well you always did take a gloomy view said cheret you can read the signs how you like but there may be other ways to explain them anyway I've got watches at every point and I'm going to deal with one thing at a time when I better look at the fellow we have CAU then I'll begin to worry about something else it's my guess you won't find much in that little fell said gag he may have had nothing to do with a real Mischief the big fell with a sharp sword doesn't

          
          36:23:14
          seem to have thought him worth much anyhow just left him lying regular Elish trick we'll see come on now we've talked enough let's go and have a look at the prisoner what are you going to do with him don't forget I spotted him first if there's any game me and my Lads must be in it now now growled chat I have my orders and it's more than my belly's Worth or yours to break him any trespasser found by the guard is to be held at the tower prisoner is to be stripped full description of every article garment weapon letter ring or

          
          36:23:54
          trinket is to be sent to L BS at once and to L BS only and the Prisoner is to be kept safe and intact under pain of death for every member of the G until he sends or comes himself that's plain enough and that's what I'm going to do stri said gag what Teeth nails hair and all no none of that he's for L BS I tell you he's wanted safe and whole you'll find that difficult laughed gag he's nothing but carrying now what L BS will do with such stuff I can't guess he might as well go in in the pot you fool

          
          36:24:37
          snarled shagrat you've been talking very clever but there's a lot you don't know though most other folks do you'll be for the pot or for Shob if you don't take care caran is that all you know of her ladyship when she binds with cords she's after meat she doesn't eat dead meat nor suck Cold Blood this fellow isn't dead Sam reeled clutching at the stone he felt as if the whole Dark World was turning upside down so great was the shock that he almost swoed but even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses

          
          36:25:20
          deep inside him he was aware of the comment you fool he isn't dead and your heart knew it don't trust your head Sam wise it's not the best part of you the trouble with you is that you never really had any hope now what is to be done for the moment nothing but to prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen listen to the vile orc voices G said shagrat she's got more than one poison when she's hunting she just gives them a dab in the neck and they go as limp as boned fish and then she has her way with them do you

          
          36:26:00
          remember old oak we lost him for days then we found him in a corner hanging up he was but he was wide awake and glaring how we laughed she'd forgotten him maybe but we didn't touch him no good interfering with her nah this little filth he'll wake up in a few hours and Beyond feeling a bit sick for a bit he'll be all right or would be if L BS would let him alone and of course Beyond Wonder where he is and what's happened to him and what's going to happen to him laughed goag we can tell him a few

          
          36:26:43
          stories at any rate if we can't do anything else I don't suppose he's ever been in lovely L War so he may like to know what to expect this is going to be more funny than I thought let's go there going to be no fun I tell you said shagrat and he's got to be kept safe or we're all As Good As Dead all right but if I were you I'd catch the big one that's loose before you sending any report to L B it won't sound too pretty to say you've caught the kitten and let the cat escape the voices began to move away Sam

          
          36:27:26
          heard the sound of feet receding he was recovering from his shock and now a wild Fury was on him I've got it all wrong he cried I knew I would now they've got him the Devils the filth never leave your master never never that was my right Rule and I knew it in my heart may I be forgiven now I've got to get back to him somehow somehow he drew his sword again and beat on the stone with a hilt but it only gave out a dull sound the sword however blazed so brightly now that he could see dimly in its light to his surprise he noticed that

          
          36:28:08
          the great block was shaped like a heavy door and was less than twice his own height above it was a dark Blank Space Between the top and the low arch of the opening it was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of Shob fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning with his remaining strength Sam leaped and caught the top scrambled up and dropped and then he ran madly sword blazing in hand round a bend and up a winding tunnel the news that his master

          
          36:28:41
          was still alive roused him to a last effort Beyond thought of weariness he could not see anything ahead for this new passage twisted and turned constantly but he thought he was catching the two Hawks up their voices were growing nearer again now they seemed quite close that's what I'm going to do said Shag R in angry tones put him right up in the top chamber what for growled gorbag haven't you any lockups down below he's going out of Harm's Way I tell you answered shrat see he's precious I don't trust all my Lads and

          
          36:29:22
          none of yours nor you neither when you're mad for fun he's going where I want him and where you won't come if you don't keep civil up to the top I say you'll be safe there Willie said Sam you're forgetting the great big Elish Warrior that's loose and with that he raced round the last Corner only to find that by some trick of the tunnel or of the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance the two orc Figures were still somewhere ahead he could see them now black and squat against the red glare

          
          36:30:02
          the passage ran straight at last up at incline and at the end wide open were great double doors leading probably to deep Chambers far below the high Horn of the tower already the Orcs with their burden had passed inside gorbag and shagrat were Drawing Near the gate Sam heard a burst of horse singing blaring of horns and banging of gongs a hideous clamor gorag and shagrat were already on the threshold Sam yet yelled and brandished sting but his little voice was drowned in the tumult no one heeded him the great door slammed two

          
          36:30:44
          Boom the bars of iron fell into place inside clang the gate was shot Sam hurled himself against the bolted Brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground he was out in the darkness Frodo was alive but taken by the enemy the end you've been listening to The Two Towers the second book in The Lord of the Rings by JRR tolken narrated by Robert englas the Lord of the Rings continues in book three
